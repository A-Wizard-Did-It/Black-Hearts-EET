@166=~I guess we're hostages or something. I'm just trying the floors clean.~
@167=~Oh, Kelddath ain't gonna like this. Gonna take forever to clean the floors now.~
@168=~Heya.~
@169=~And who might you be?~
@170=~Get out of my way.~
@171=~Nobody important. Go see Kelddath for temple business. I just clean the floors. 'Tis lean times.~
@172=~You talked ta me, loudmouth. Go see Kelddath if you have temple business. Get off my clean floor.~
@173=~Get off my floor. Nothin' gonna mess my nice clean floor.~

// BRAN

@174=~Whatcha talkin' to me for? Those guys look like they wanna kill you.~
@175=~Those guys weren't so bad. Well, except the gnoll. It pooped in the corner. Watch yer step.~
@176=~We should get doors. They swiped the chairs. Nice floor though.~
@177=~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, spiffy floor.~

// Amaran

@178=~You. I recognize you as the one who cleansed the defilement that the Iron Throne visited upon these woods. Yet even still, that does not make you an honored guest in these woods.~
@179=~Still, for your services, I will stay the hand of nature for the moment. Speak what you wish.~
@180=~These woods are Tiax's woods! It is he who stays the hand of nature for you!~
@181=~(Low) Shadow Druids, always good for a laugh, eh? You do them a solid, they promise not to kill you this very moment.~
@182=~Really? I took care of a serious threat to your people and you still can barely stand to see me?~
@183=~Of course, Archdruid. I won't take much of your time. An assassin tried to kill me using strange druidic magics. I wanted to see if you knew anything about this?~
@184=~Do not deceive yourself that the Iron Throne were any more than a thorn in our sides. Nature would have disposed of them in time, and we are the weapons through which she would wield their destruction. Now speak quickly, or else I lose my patience.~
@185=~The pride of these druids is too singular. I doubt they would admit to needing aid even in the most dire circumstances.~
@186=~Fine. An assassin tried to kill me using strange druidic magics. I wanted to see if you knew anything about this?~
@187=~Hmm... it was no Shadow Druid that attempted to kill you. But I believe I know who it was. You are the victim of an attack from the Harper, Riezen Darkeyes. He came to us a few moons before your initial arrival into Cloakwood, asking for our assistance.~
@188=~He is a man who has turned his back on his Harper kin. Yet I knew instantly that his heart bore a greater darkness, one stained by his service to the Harpers! He could never be one of us.~
@189=~For a people who claim to hold to neutrality, the Shadow Druids view the world in stark black and whites.~
@190=~What do you mean that his heart was dark?~
@191=~Do you know where he went after you sent him away?~
@192=~How do I know that I can trust that this wasn't your doing?~
@193=~He may have spoke of the ills of society and his desire to bring the walls of civilization down, but his venom was still reserved for only a few enemies, ones he would not disclose. It troubled me that he would hide his true intentions from us, so I would not allow him to stay.~
@194=~He came to them for help but they only turned him away. It's... rather sad, actually.~
@195=~Did he say anything about Red Wizards?~
@196=~Do you know where he went after you sent him away?~
@197=~No. His service of nature was such that we allowed him to leave unharassed. But I care not where he went after. Know only that he is not welcome in Cloakwood. As the Archdruid of this forest, I would know well if he remained here yet.~
@198=~Unless he's hidin' 'em somewhere. Might be best ta gut 'em n' then toss the place to be safe.~
@199=~Ok. Thank you Archdruid.~
@200=~Thanks for nothing.~
@201=~I care not if I have your trust. The ground beneath your feet did not swallow you when you entered Cloakwood. That will be proof enough that we do not mean you harm.~
@202=~How did you know his heart was false?~
@203=~Do you know where he went after you sent him away?~
@204=~Little. Only that some had come to Baldur's Gate to enact a plan that he claimed put both civilzation and nature in the region at risk. It matters naught to me. These Red Wizards are no better or worse than any civilized people.~
@205=~Far better, I assure you. (Though this savage would not be able to tell a place of culture from a Rashemen outhouse.)~
@206=~Far worse, though I doubt thou wilst listen to reason.~
@207=~Now that you have heard my words, leave this place for good. You will not be welcome again.~

// Barmaid

@208=~Seat yeself as ye wish. I'll be with ye shortly.~
@209=~Wasn't right what ye did ta ole Marl there. He may of been an arse, but it was too far what ye did.~
@210=~I apologize for ole Marl. He may be a grump, but he's a good man at heart.~
@211=~What can I get ye two te drink? Uh w-will it be the usual, miss Sera?~
@212=~At o-once, my lady.~
@213=~Your drinks. I hope you do enjoy. Let me know if there's anything else.~
@214=~*Take and sample the glass of Ruby Wine.*~
@215=~*Take and sample the glass of Berduskan Dark Wine.*~
@216=~*Take and sample the glass of Evermead.*~
@217=~*Take and sample the tea.*~
@218=~*Take and sample the ale.*~
@219=~*Take and have a sip of the water.*~
@220=~*At a first sniff, you detect an aroma of juniper and anise. At the taste, the wine fills your senses with a tart sweetness. It's strong, but not too strong, and the aftertaste leaves a hint of dryness that makes you thirsty for more.*~
@221=~*As you take in the dark wine, your senses are immediately greeted with a pungent berry aroma. Even your light first sip fills your mouth with its full body taste. It is an almost gritty, seedy flavor that lingers long after you've swallowed. You can see why such a bold choice is a favorite to Illasera.*~
@222=~*The Evermead is unassuming at first, delivered in a glass barely as deep as your thumb. Its beige color and inert scent leaves you wondering if they got your order wrong at first. However, that first taste is an explosion of flavor. Honeyed sweetness fills your senses, never to an overwhelming degree, but in such a refined quality that you are almost taken out of the world around you for a moment. It's not only the flavor, the sweet mead seems to transplant you to some hidden misty grove filled with dewdrop soaked leaves. You briefly forget you are at the table. Even as you swallow, the aftertaste promises to linger for days, even weeks, making you wonder if you need even take another sip at all.*~
@223=~*You are served a black tea in a small porcelain cup. It has a flowery aroma, though unfortunately the tea itself seems rather plain and has little flavor to it. Still, you do find it refreshing in its own right and it sets a peaceful tone to this conversation.*~
@224=~*The ale you are served is cool and frothy. It has a honeyed and nutty taste as it washes over your mouth and while certainly not the best ale you've ever had, it's quite refreshing.*~
@225=~*It seems that you are served reasonably fresh rainwater. It tastes clear and refreshing, even a hint oaky, likely due to the barrel it was stored in.*~

// Bartender

@226=~I hope ya looking for 'em to put the boot down. I asked 'em kindly to leave, but that only seemed to encourage 'em further! Poor Ed's boy, taken far before his time. Listen, I don't know exactly where they was goin' to, but after spilling blood on my floor, they did start jabbering about needing to pay the gods their dues. Seemed more like they were fixing to get into more trouble than any proper atoning.~
@227=~I heard that some adventurers made quite a mess in here earlier. Do you know where they might have gone to?~

// Begger

@228=~Eh? This is my tunnel! I founds it first. Leave me be!~
@229=~Sorry, but do you know what's up ahead?~
@230=~I should go.~
@231=~Ehehe it confounds the senses, doesn't it? Everytime ya walk up that way, ya end up right back here. Some kinda witchcraft, no doubt.~

// Cherise

@232=~Hm. <CHARNAME>. I would say that I am surprised to see you, but your reputation precedes you. You've become quite the nuisance to several interested parties in the region.~
@233=~Should I assume you are aware of who I am? Introductions are tiresome and I've never cared for them. Perhaps we will just skip to the part where I kill you slowly?~
@234=~Anything worth doin' is worth takin' your time. So I'll make sure you got time ta pray to your gods before we reckon your soul to its just end.~
@235=~I'm here to put an end to your plots Cherise. I'll allow you a chance to surrender.~
@236=~I've always preferred talking, even to my foes. I wouldn't mind a chat, even if this does come to blows.~
@237=~I'm so glad to hear you say that. The words of a soon-to-be-dead Red Wizard matter little to me.~
@238=~Heroes are so tiresome. No, I don't believe I will be doing the surrendering. You've done quite the foolish thing, bumbling into an archmage with a full complement of Thayan agents. How you survived this long I...~
@239=~I might respect such an attitude, were you not intruding upon my lair with intent to lay waste to my plans. You've done quite the foolish thing, bumbling into an archmage with a full complement of Thayan agents. How you survived this long I...~
@240=~Your savage demeanor certainly defies few expectations. You've done quite the foolish thing, bumbling into an archmage with a full complement of Thayan agents. How you survived this long I...~
@241=~What is it?~
@242=~Gods be damned, this was a distraction! <CHARNAME>, I'm impressed. A simultaneous attack on both my physical and astral site is more than I had expected. Dare I ask who your accomplice is?~
@243=~Sounds to me like we may have been granted the role of 'unwitting pawns' in this tiresome play.~
@244=~Accomplice? You DARE to insinuate that Tiax requires a partner? Tiax knows and does all! It is probably an idle whim of his that attacks you.~
@245=~Hmph. If I can suggest, I believe our benefactor may not have sat this one out in the bar. Although it troubles me that she would not tell us of her plans.~
@246=~Oh Illasera my dear, you are so full of surprises aren't you?~
@247=~I don't know what you're talking about. I have no idea about this other attack.~
@248=~Uhh, yes, clearly this was my plan. It's all come together just as I... planned it?~
@249=~You're being attacked elsewhere? Now, that *is* curious.~
@250=~Bah, it doesn't matter! While the menagerie is in stasis, it is vulnerable. I cannot let myself be detained a moment longer. Malachai, take care of this fool. It is your life or theirs, do I make myself clear?~
@251=~Die here, <CHARNAME>, and spare yourself the agony I would inflict on you were I to stay.~
@252=~So my assassins finally arrive to finish me. By the dead Lord, I should not be so surprised. Sarevok could not have been more wrong about you. I must congratulate you on this... the whole 'naive ward of a cloistered monk' cover was impeccable.~
@253=~I'm here to stop you Cherise. Surrender and I promise to spare you here and let the courts decide your fate.~
@254=~What are you talking about? I haven't assumed any cover.~
@255=~I'm no assassin. I came here because your actions with Sarevok against me.~
@256=~Hold on, what assassins were you expecting exactly?~
@257=~Fine. I think I will be better off extricating your secrets from your corpse. Silmivya! Dannimus! Hold nothing back!~
@258=~You haven't... no, I refuse to accept that. You are *someone* of consequence. You have a master that has sent you to kill me. This cannot be the happenstance of blind idiots!~
@259=~Who are you calling an idiot! If you're so smart, then what's uh, seventy-two times ten?? HUH?~
@260=~Worse than just idiots... confoundingly aggravating idiots.~
@261=~No, I have led my own path these last months. It was the actions of others who thrust me into events here.~
@262=~There's no point in discussing it further. I came here to kill you. So I'm going to do exactly that.~
@263=~Well, I guess technically Ilasera sent me here, though I wouldn't call her a master.~
@264=~Bhaal is apparently my father, if that makes things any better?~
@265=~Do not play the fool! You are *someone* of consequence. You have a master that has sent you to kill me. This cannot be the happenstance of blind idiots!~
@266=~Impossible... I... no, you are not lying, I can tell. But that does not mean you do not have strings that even you cannot see. If Sarevok was so specific about your death, it must have been because...~
@267=~I see. Like Sarevok, you are also a child of the dead Lord. I suppose it was inevitable that others like him would rise to challenge him. He was a fool to underestimate it.~
@268=~Sarevok has forced me to answer his challenge. I did not wish for this.~
@269=~I don't want to 'challenge' him. I want to kill him.~
@270=~Are we done here? I'm tired of talk. It's time to die, witch.~
@271=~A Bhaalspawn? That... I see. He was a fool to underestimate you. I suppose it was inevitable that others like him would rise to challenge him.~
@272=~Oh child. We are too tied to fate to decide our own. Like you both, I am also ensnared in the machinations of the Dead Lord. Although, where Sarevok would inherit his father's legacy, I seek to simply survive it.~
@273=~I'll never hold it against a woman for just trying to live to see another day, but you really did mess this one up by drawing our attention.~
@274=~You don't mean that you're also a child of Bhaal, are you?~
@275=~Spoken as your father would. Like you and your brother, I am also ensnared in the machinations of a dead god. Although where he seeks to inherit his father's legacy, I seek to simply survive it.~
@276=~No. But the dead god's taint does not follow only his children. We who planted the seeds in preparation for his death share that inheritance. Yes, I am a former member of the Deathstalker cult.~
@277=~But while each 'faithful servant' supplicated themselves with their right hand out, they kept their left hidden, plotting and scheming for Bhaal's death to serve their own ends above all others.~
@278=~As well they should. No master is worth serving unless they can become a stepping off point to grow our own power.~
@279=~Speak plainly. What are you insinuating and why should I care?~
@280=~Is someone's hunting you? Someone that was from within Bhaal's own cult?~
@281=~Listen, this chat is fun and all, but I'm bored now.~
@282=~I am saying that someone is systematically destroying every last shred of Bhaal's former cult. Eliminating the 'competition', for whatever endgame Bhaal had envisioned.~
@283=~What she is saying... tis t-troubling. I have heard reports from other Harpers of many disappearances of cultists that were being t-tracked. I always attributed it t-to good fortune, but perhaps tis not so...~
@284=~And you as a former member of the cult are now being targeted?~
@285=~Bhaal's mortal body had hardly lay still on Boareskyr Bridge before Deathstalkers began to die in droves. Some attributed the death of so many assassins to some divine connection they had to Bhaal. I knew better. Someone from within was acting against us.~
@286=~I fled early, knowing I could not trust any of my former 'allies', for one of them had to be the reason. For a time, Thay seemed like a suitable haven. Yet even there I knew I would not be safe forever. I bid my time, bowing before the Zulkirs while I gathered my power.~
@287=~And now I have come back to the Sword Coast. I will hide no longer. I have made my wager and I will see it through to the end. But now we come back to the issue of you. You may have not been sent here to kill me, but your presence is an unacceptable risk either way.~
@288=~I don't suppose there is going to be any talking you into a surrender, is there? I have mercy, even for a former Bhaal cultist.~
@289=~I had no illusions this could go either way. Prepare yourself.~
@290=~You won't live long enough to see Sarevok fall, old crone cultist.~
@291=~Surrender? Oh, what a quaint notion. No. There can be no surrender. If you came to me, it will not be long before the Blackheart follows.~
@292=~I cannot decide if you are yet another puppet pulled by invisible strings, or strangely overlooked anomaly of your father's legacy. You should give some consideration to that question as well, with what few moments of life you have left.~
@293=~Silmivya! Dannimus! Hold nothing back!~

@297=~Sister, look who has found our glade.~
@298=~Not like those nasty humans who have passed by our tree I hope. What were they called?~
@299=~I believe they were called 'bandits' dear sister.~
@300=~Not many of those around any longer. I do so wonder what happened to them.~
@301=~Well I won't much miss their loud trudging around. One even marked our tree! So rude!~
@302=~That was not a bandit, dear sister. That was from those excitable young humans who would embrace at the roots of our tree.~
@303=~Oh yes, them! I miss them. They made such sweet sounds beneath us while we reposed in the branches.~
@304=~Repose, dear sister? Each time I looked, you were watching with such fascination.~
@305=~*giggle* Oh did you see me do so? They were ever so interesting.~ 
@306=~These two creatures may be the most intolerable and annoying surfacer beings I've encountered yet.~
@307=~They're so entrancing. I don't suppose after our business is concluded here, I could stay behind to uh, regale them with some songs?~
@308=~*giggle* Oh, you are a very funny city-dweller! And your aura is quite captivating. Much like our last visitor, even. Perhaps we should keep you here to serve us?~
@309=~Hey! Find your own servants, you woodland skanks. This group is claimed.~
@310=~Forever? Now wait a minute...~
@311=~Oh, hello <RACE>. You must forgive my sister and I. We did not expect visitors to our glade. Though we do not mind!~
@312=~Shush, sister! They look so interesting! You musn't judge me so. I won't pounce, I promise. Unless they ask nicely.~
@313=~For two such lovely ladies, I could ask so sweetly. And I do not mind a little pouncing, scratching, or biting.~
@314=~Oh sister, can we have this one? Look, he is so pretty and interested. And when he is done serving us, his elf blood would water the daisies nicely.~
@315=~My elf blood? Ah well... maybe I should reconsider. Apologies ladies, I will simply have to be satisfied with appreciating your beauty from afar.~
@316=~<CHARNAME>, lets do our business quickly and get out of here, before the brains of all of our inclined party are turned to mush.~
@317=~Right. Well, I actually came here looking for some help. Could either of you ladies identify a spell for me? It seems druidic in nature.~
@318=~I've sort of forgotten why I came here in the first place now.~
@319=~I wouldn't mind being pounced.~
@320=~A spell? What a strange request!~
@321=~With our tree, we might be able to trace the spell, or at least uncover the nature of its caster.~
@322=~Yes yes, you know that to us, our tree is a very beating heart. It would be like asking us to spill blood for you. Why should we help you, <RACE>?~
@323=~I will have no qualms of spilling their blood, should you need <CHARNAME>. My blade would most enjoy being soaked in it.~
@324=~I was told you knew Illasera and that you owed her a favor. She asked me to do this on her behalf.~
@325=~Illasera... Illasera. Sister, do you remember who that might be?~
@326=~Oh yes! Ah I am so bad with names though. Surely I do remember her yes. For friends of Illasera, we could help. Come now, let me see, let me see!~
@327=~Here you are.~
@328=~Ooo look at this one. Isn't it creepy, sister.~
@329=~You are so impossible! It's gross. And most unnatural. This spider should be so much smaller. Look... the magic made it grow quicker than it was ready to! Its body would have split open like over-ripe fruit, if it hadn't been squished first.~
@330=~I hear it as well. Such a sad song. And what's that? A name? Rie zen Dark of Eyes? And notes of music, like from an instrument their kind uses.~ 
@331=~Wait. Riezen Darkeyes? I know this man.~
@332=~Perhaps Riezen Darkeyes? That sounds more like a name we would use in civilization.~
@333=~Name ring a bell, Jaheira?~
@334=~One who uses a harp? One who harps, they says!~
@335=~More harpers here? Blast and damnation, I hate those string-fiddlers!~
@336=~Monty, do control yourself! Oh, the very word 'harp' makes him so incredibly cross. And I quite livid as well.~
@337=~One who harps? Could it be a Harper?~
@338=~Yes! I think so yes! The word sounds similar to what is spoken by the leaves.~
@339=~A Harper. Interesting.~
@340=~Oh harps make such beautiful music. We should charm a harpist to play us music all day long, sister.~
@341=~Oh of course. That is all the leaves will tell us, <RACE>. Oh, he has hidden himself most deviously, this Darkeyes!~
@342=~I suppose that will have to do then. Thank you girls for your help.~
@343=~Before I go, I actually wonder. What exactly did Illasera do for you two?~
@344=~We have that effect on your kind *giggles*.~
@345=~Most unkind, sister! It is not an act. But come <race>, you must know why you came here. Think haaaaarder *giggles*~
@346=~I'm thinking as hard as I can! <CHARNAME>, you're embaressing us by looking stupid in front of them!~
@347=~Right. Well, I actually came here looking for some help. Could either of you ladies identify a spell for me? It seems druidic in nature.~
@348=~Oh, her aura was quite dark, and we were worried she came to take advantage of our weakened tree!~
@349=~Were they threats? I didn't even notice.~
@350=~Her nature was so unique! I couldn't help myself. She had a dark elegance to her.~
@351=~Sister, your charms hardly did any better. She had prepared wards against them.~
@352=~In return, she helped to rejuvinate our tree! Oh, its leaves look so much more lush now. The acorns were a small gift in return.~
@353=~She did not seem to mind so much either by the end. *giggles*~
@354=~Right. Well, I think that's everything I need from you two. Farewell.~
@355=~My sister robs me of my fun so cruelly. What did you need, <RACE>?~
@356=~Right. Well, I actually came here looking for some help. Could either of you ladies identify a spell for me? It seems druidic in nature.~
@357=~Be well! Give Illasera our best wishes. Perhaps she can return sometime!~
@358=~Another <RACE>, so soon after the last who vis- oh, no wait, you *are* the same as the last to visit us! It can be so difficult to tell you apart at times. Fly free <RACE>, our tree is no home for you!~

@371=~They're so entrancing. I don't suppose after our business is concluded here, I could stay behind to uh, regale them with some songs?~
@372=~Oh, -you- do not mind sister. You can hardly stop yourself from staring. You look ready to pounce.~
@373=~Yes, I don't believe anyone has ever asked us to identify a spell for them before. This <RACE> is peculiar indeed, sister!~
@374=~It would be difficult, and sap some of our tree's power.~
@375=~Oh come now sister. It's the part-elf woman with the gray eyes who visited us some time ago. You were ever so keen on her.~
@376=~I think spiders are cute! That one is especially adorable. Look at its precious front legs.~
@377=~You are indeed right about that, sister. The poor thing. It had sisters as well, all dead now. I can hear the leaves lamenting it as the wind rushes through them.~
@378=~The names of their kind do not have so many pauses in them sister. Riezen Darkeyes, yes that is what the leaves say. And that instrument is what they call a harp, I do believe.~
@379=~If one happens by our glade, that sounds like a treat. But we should be seeing the nice <RACE> off before we cause any other trouble, don't you think?~
@380=~Try to ignore my sister's silliness. She puts on such an act, it's cruel to the city folk!~
@381=~She came for our acorns, demanding them with prickly threats and icy glares.~
@382=~That's because you were quite distracted by something else, dear sister. She had her bow drawn at you even as you fawned over her.~
@383=~And quite immune to your charms, dear sister.~
@384=~She was a clever city-dweller, that one. It did take some convincing for her to not to take but to instead trade.~
@385=~Though the leaves have a shade darker hue to them. But I think they look lovely still. We were ever so grateful for her to gift a part of herself to us.~
@386=~Bad sister! We are still rejuvinating, you know we should not do such things. Please, ignore my sister's forwardness.~
@387=~Run away <RACE>, before my sister's charms snare you!~
@388=~You are welcome to rest under our tree if you wish. I will make sure my sister does not try anything while you sleep *giggles*~

@389=~*muttering* I'll need to reach out to my uncle. Gods, what do I even say to him? He'll be furious with me, no doubt. No... no, he'd just be mad at her. Oh Lathander *sigh* we'll need to find a way to come together for this.~
@390=~Aww, poor guy. Maybe I can conjure up some flowers to make him feel better. Oh wait no... bad idea, Neera. Last time you tried to do that, the flowers has razor sharp teeth and spat acid...~
@391=~Excuse me? I don't mean to bother you, but could I have a moment?~
@392=~Hey, you. Were you a part of the caravan that was raided by hobgoblins south of here?~
@393=~Huh? Oh, I didn't see you there. Yes, I am. I apologize, I am not q-quite together at the moment. Is there something you need?~
@394=~I'm trying to look into the attack on your caravan. Could you describe the attack, in as much detail as you are able to?~
@395=~You want to...? Oh, oh yes of course. Let me think. We were heading north from Nashkel. The attack came during the early evening. We had stopped for the night, pulling our cart off the Coast Road.~
@396=~While we gathered by the fire and shared a meal, there was a sudden flash, like a bolt of lightning. One of the caravan guards was thrown backwards as a thunderous sound echoed through the woods. I went to go check on him, but his skin was black and burned and it was too late.~
@397=~Then they descended. Monstrous beastly people who moved faster than I've ever seen one move before. My mother... she rose to try and organize us into a retreat. I saw as she was cut down... as the life faded from her eyes...~
@398=~*gulp* I apologize. I scrambled to try and help her, but I took a blow to the head from the hobgoblin's blade. He must have hit me with the flat side of it though, as I was only knocked unconscious.~
@399=~They must have thought me dead, as I was awoken later amid the wreck of our caravan. A few had escaped and came back in the morning. We took what was left of the supplies and trekked back up to Beregost.~
@400=~Y-you must n-not blame yourself. You went through a t-terrible ordeal. You m-must just t-take the days one at a time now. You will g-get through this.~
@401=~Khalid, there is no need to coddle the man like he is a child. But still, my husband does speak true. This pain will fade in time.~
@402=~Thank you truly for your concern. I did not expect such sentiments to come from strangers.~
@403=~I am deeply sorry for your loss. May I ask your name?~
@404=~So you blacked out for most of the attack. I take it you didn't see where they went to after?~
@405=~Useless. If you can't conjure up a single bit of useful information, your dear mommy is never getting avenged.~
@406=~It is Elenair. And I thank you. My mother was a courageous woman and even in her elder years, she never seemed to slow down. I don't think the caravan company will survive without her leadership.~
@407=~If the role now falls to such a feeble, weak-willed man, then this caravan company is doomed. UGH! Why do you placate this meek minnow’s confidence when he should be taking up a sword to get his revenge?~
@408=~The Realms will be lesser for her absence. I am certain she will be well cared for by the Morninglord in the beyond.~
@409=~The caravan company is not what matters now. What matters now is that she be avenged. Is there anything else you can tell me? Any signs that might have been left?~
@410=~No. I am afraid that I did not. I apologize, I was distracted at the time.~
@411=~I understand, but I'm not going to be able to help you if you can't provide me anything else. Think carefully. Was there anything you noticed after the attack? Any clues that might hint where they may have gone?~
@412=~Please, I'm sorry but I don't know what else I can say to help you. *sigh* Hold a moment, let me think. I've failed enough already. Maybe there's something I can remember...~
@413=~You're too kind. But you're not with the Flaming Fist? You're some kind of mercenary? I'm surprised. It's not common for mercenaries to be capable of such compassion.~
@414=~Mercenaries? Oh ho, no! We are heroes! Evil will shake in their tiny shoes when they hear our warcry!~
@415=~I'm not like most mercenaries. It saddens me to see the losses endured by common folk on the Sword Coast during these times. I'd like to help however I can.~
@416=~You've had it rough. A few compassionate words is the least I can give you.~
@417=~Well, I'll not spit on such compassion by being useless. I think... there's one thing that I recall that might help you.~
@418=~Clay. There was a reddish-orange clay stains in their tunics. Such clay is common to the Red Canyons. They must have at least gone through that area.~
@419=~The Red Canyons? Where is that exactly?~
@420=~That's it then? Are you sure that's as much as you can recall?~
@421=~I know the spot. Guess that's where I'll have to start looking. Thank you.~
@422=~South-west of Beregost, about halfway between here and the sea. The rocks are very distinctive as you pass by. A deep red-orange, like sunset.~
@423=~I know the area. <CHARNAME>, this region is best reached by heading to High Hedge in the west, then going directly south. It should take near a day’s march to get there from here.~
@424=~Thank you for your time, Elenair. You've been a great help.~
@425=~That's all I need then. Your mother will be avenged soon.~
@426=~Finally, some useful information. Farewell.~
@427=~Yes, I think so. I'd tell you more if I could, but it is the best I can manage. The Red Canyons are where I would search.~
@428=~The Red Canyons? Where is that exactly?~
@429=~Good luck in your search. May the Morninglord bless your travels, friend.~
@430=~I hope that I was able to help. My mother would be happy to know that adventurers of such grace sought to right the wrongs of the Sword Coast.~
@431=~I hope that whatever information I provided helps you find my mother's murderers.~
@432=~Knowing my mother's butchers have been killed brings me no joy, but I will at least sleep easier knowing that they will not pray on another.~

// Herald of Yaga Shura (Released)

@433=~You have done well little one! Ahh it feels good to stretch my legs! And feel it! KOSSUTH! HEAR ME! GRANT ME YOUR EVERBURNING RAGE!~
@434=~But... what is this? You do not mean that this little one...? Surely it cannot be... but...~
@435=~Ah, a shame, a shame. Little One, Kossuth has shown me the truth, and it seems that you are not so insignificant as I thought. I cannot allow any threat to my master’s ascension to live. But hate me not, for I grant you this final kindness for releasing me! A quick death, something that immortal Yaga-Shura would not be so generous to grant you.~

// Herald of Yaga Shura

@436=~HMMMM...~
@437=~Wow! He's big. Do ya think he'd let us ride on his shoulder?~
@438=~Uh, hi.~
@439=~Who are you?~
@440=~Are you trapped, Giant?~
@441=~Have you returned to hear the glories of Yaga-Shura, or can I expect you to release me from this prison?~
@442=~No, just passing by.~
@443=~Yes, I have the wardstone. How do I free you?~
@444=~Hello little one. HMM... you are different from the other red ones who imprisoned me.~
@445=~Tiax is not small! He is merely unassuming... until the day he rules all! Then he will be larger than this giant. Ten times larger! You will see.~
@446=~I am no Red Wizard, if that’s what you mean.~
@447=~No, I am not. What is your name, Giant?~
@448=~I have forsaken my name in service of the coming god. Who I am is not important, only the one I have given all my being to. Know me only as the Herald of the Yaga-Shura.~
@449=~Tis a remarkable sacrifice to give to ones god. I respect this one greatly for his faith!~
@450=~Who is Yaga-Shura?~
@451=~Yes, I am bound by this magical field. However, this arcane prison will not hold me for long. It may take days, it may take weeks, but in time the Herald of Yaga-Shura will walk the lands of the Savage Coast once again.~
@452=~An ominous premonition. Giant-folk should remain in their mountains, not striding among people.~
@453=~Who is Yaga-Shura?~
@454=~It is what I mean, yes. If you are not ones who imprisoned me, then you have not earned my rage. We may speak.~
@455=~Very well. What is your name, Giant?~
@456=~Hahaha! Yaga-Shura is the coming god! One who has conquered the mighty Giant tribes of the Marching Mountains. One who has tamed Death itself! Immortal Yaga-Shura, may your name forever shake the very earth and hearts of all giantkind and lesser mortals!~
@457=~I've heard of no such deity before. It could be a nascent demigod, but most likely is just some pretender building a legend for themselves.~
@458=~I see. What can you tell me about this place, Herald?~
@459=~You look stuck there. Perhaps we could arrange a bargain?~
@460=~Sounds like an interesting fellow.~
@461=~Little. A crossroad within the Astral realm. I sense it connects to the elemental planes at key points. The blessed fires of Kossuth burn just beyond the veil around us. Were I to be free, I could surely harness the latent power of it around me.~
@462=~“Interesting”? Hahaha, you little men are so amusing. I think “Interesting” will be far from your lips when you see his power. And make no mistake, you will.~
@463=~Ahh, good! I was just now thinking the same.~
@464=~I am imprisoned by this magical field. I rage against it! I can already feel the energies that contain me stressed and cracking. I will break free of my own will, but it is better to have one's freedom earlier than later all the same.~
@465=~Assist me in shattering my cage and I will grant you a boon. A magical item that I carry with me, perfectly suited for a small man’s stature, such as you. I will give this item to you. And once I have been freed of this prison, I will bring down the citadel of the one who imprisoned me!~
@466=~How would I go about helping you with this?~
@467=~It just so happens that I’m here to destroy the witch in the citadel as well. Maybe our interests align, giant.~
@468=~No, I don’t think I’ll be helping you.~
@469=~Recently, chaos was sown in this prison. A little woman like you invaded, and the mage who controls this realm released the wards on the other prisoners. Irritatingly, she did not choose to free me. She knew well my power and rage at her.~
@470=~After this, the little red men have been scurrying about, attempting pitifully to gain control. One of these little men carries a ward stone on him that is keyed to my prison. Kill him for it, or pry it from his dead hands, and bring it back to me. This will be enough to grant me freedom.~
@471=~What assurances do I have that you wouldn’t just attack me once free?~
@472=~Very well, I’ll do as you ask.~
@473=~I’ll think about it.~
@474=~Uh, you mean this wardstone?~
@475=~Very good! Then once free, you only need stand aside and let the Herald of Yaga-Shura reduce your enemy to cinders! All the more reason to free me.~
@476=~Foolish! Bah, no matter. But if you do change your mind, bring me back the wardstone that one of the little red men carries. It is keyed to this prison and only it can fully dispel the bonds placed on me.~
@477=~What assurances? Ha! What assurances may an ant ask of the boot that would step on them? But my mission here was to spread word of the mighty coming of my master, not to crush all you little men under my heel. I would not attack you without reason, this I vow.~
@478=~The giant seems quite insane. It's best never to count on charity, and doubly so that of a madman's reasoning.~
@479=~Very well, I’ll do as you ask.~
@480=~I’ll think about it.~
@481=~Good. Good! I await your return, little one.~
@482=~Mmmm... it matters not. Return to me or do not. I will have my freedom in time.~
@483=~Haha! You have done well, little one! Yes yes, simply hold it in your hand and move it in the air in this pattern towards me...~

// The Gentleman

@484=~Hail little ones. Forgive me, but I do not suppose you are traveling to the great library of Candlekeep, are you?~
@485=~That... is a polite ogre-mage. Anyone else think he's kinda cute, in a big hunky sorta way?~
@486=~Villain! Meet justice RAAGHHH-rrr wait. Boo, this one looks like an ogre but sounds like a Wychlaran. Minsc is so confused.~
@487=~Hail. I am not going to Candlekeep. Rather, I have come to speak with you. My name is <CHARNAME>. What may I call you?~
@488=~No. Actually, I was just headed the other way in fact...~
@489=~I've come here to draw steel, fiend. Surrender what you've stolen and perhaps I will let you leave with your life.~
@490=~Ah yes, it was only a matter of time I suppose until those armed with steel and magic would confront me. I offer my humble greetings, <CHARNAME>. Please, call me the Gentleman.~
@491=~This is like, really weird right? I feel like this is weird. Is it weird? Gettin' harder to tell anymore.~
@492=~I am pleased that you have chosen to parlay instead of resorting to base violence. Let me first assure you that I mean you no ill and, should you not present hostilities toward me, you need worry no harm from me.~
@493=~How wonderful to trade in words rather than fists. Let us endeavor to resolve this matter without bloodshed~
@494=~I'm glad to hear it. It's rather uncommon to meet an ogre-mage who would rather speak than attack.~
@495=~Violence may or may not occur, but I would at least know your reasons for waylaying travelers to Candlekeep.~
@496=~Good. Now let me be straight with you. I need for you to hand over the books you've stolen and leave this area at once, and never return.~
@497=~I find that very difficult to believe. You are well armed and came to this remote area off the road. No, I think you were looking just for me. But perhaps seeing me, you have cold feet! *laughs* Please, please, do not be afraid. Come, and tell me what brings you here.~
@498=~Well, you have been stealing books from travelers in the area. I need for you to stop that and leave.~
@499=~I'm just a bit taken aback by how... civil you are.~
@500=~I will not surrender them. I would explain myself, if you would but listen. Or is battle the only language you speak?~
@501=~Your pitiful begging for the trade of words betrays your weakness. Ur-Gothoz will taste your blood this day.~
@502=~I begin to see why the oni of this land have had to resort to cruelty.~
@503=~You have broken the laws of the land and must face the consequences. Prepare yourself, ogre.~
@504=~Violence is how I solve most problems. Don't take it personally.~
@505=~Fine. I'll stay my hand a moment. Explain yourself.~
@506=~As a guest to this land, it would be a stain on my honor to behave with anything other than the highest degree of courtesy towards its natives. Perhaps the "ogres-mages" as you know them in these lands are cruel and brutish, but in mine, we are a civilized people.~
@507=~*whispers* SO WEIRD.~
@508=~It's difficult for me to believe that there could be such a thing as noble ogres. Yet... perhaps in distant lands it is so.~
@509=~Deal with this one as you feel is right, but I will keep my bow trained on him. I do not trust the platitudes of his kind.~
@510=~Where exactly are you from, if I might ask?~
@511=~I do appreciate the courtesy, but it's hard to take your words at face value when you're robbing travelers like a common brigand.~
@512=~Would that it did not come to such. However, I came to your lands in order to visit the great library of Candlekeep and was rudely refused entry, even after presenting the required rare tome.~
@513=~I attempted to reason with the gatekeepers and even a monk from within, yet no words could sway them. With no other recourse available to me, I exercise the only leverage I have, hoping that the inconvenience of turning away travelers will change their mind.~
@514=~This would make for a great tale! I should compose a sonnet about this Gentleman. Uhh... what rhymes with 'ogre'? Booger, maybe? Hrm...~
@515=~Why did they refuse you entry, exactly?~
@516=~What do you want in Candlekeep? Surely there are libraries elsewhere.~
@517=~That's no reason to attack defenseless travelers.~
@518=~Regardless, I need for you to stop your attacks and leave the region.~
@519=~I am afraid that I cannot do that. If Candlekeep will turn me away so thoughtlessly, than I will take from them the only thing I am able to until I am shown the same courtesy as a native traveler.~
@520=~So much effort put towards a wasteful endeavor. Better to give up and save yourself the energy.~
@521=~I also cannot leave here until you are gone and I have the books you've stolen back.~
@522=~Unfortunate. Do not think me easy prey... or that I did not come here without protection. A shame it had to come to this.~
@523=~From far away Kara-Tur. I will not bother you with the names of lands and nations that have never graced your ears. The world is wider and grander than most know.~
@524=~Kara-Tur? Tis further away from Rashemen than Rashemen is to here. Thou must be here for a reason of great importance to have traveled so far.~
@525=~Indeed. I would have made a trip twice as long still to obtain my prize.~
@526=~I do appreciate the courtesy, but it's hard to take your words at face value when you're robbing travelers like a common brigand.~
@527=~They provided no reason, yet look upon me and ask yourself if the answer is so hard to fathom.~
@528=~Yeah, pretty sure in all our time growin' up in Candlekeep, weren't any ogres or other monster-types around. Uh, no offense.~
@529=~I take no offense, but your casual manner only makes it more obvious.~
@530=~You have to understand that your kind is considered dangerous here, and not without merit. It's unreasonable to just demand entrance.~
@531=~I suppose I could try to argue your point for you at the gate. I grew up in Candlekeep, I might be able to sway them.~
@532=~There are many libraries, but I do not come to this land for just any tome. I come for a very specific tome, and in all my research, I could only find one location which had a copy. Candlekeep.~
@533=~To come so far for only a book? Tis madness! What is it that need be known that cannot be found in battle and prayer?~
@534=~Really? All this way just for one tome?~
@535=~What's the tome?~
@536=~I took pains to ensure that each traveler was unharmed and directed to the nearest inn. They will be welcome to have their books back once I have what I need. Since I do not intend to keep what was taken, your laws would define it as 'borrowing', yes?~
@537=~Oh big guy, take it from me, that defense never works.~
@538=~That's stretching the definition of the law at best. Borrowing implies consent.~
@539=~By diverting these travelers, you've cost them much more than the book you took from them. We have a bandit problem that's plaguing the coast. You put their lives in danger.~
@540=~It won't work. Candlekeep is strictly isolationist and won't budge over the loss of a few books. Trust me, you won't be able to keep this up longer than they will.~
@541=~What makes your needs greater than the needs of those who came here? You've traveled far, but you can't just take what isn't yours to get what you want.~
@542=~Really now? You're going to personally give back every one of these books to each person you took them from?~
@543=~Then we are at an impasse. For neither of us will leave until we both have what we want. So what is it to be then? Is violence the only option left to us?~
@544=~It seems with some men, the bigger they are, the more useless words they spout. Just let me eviscerate this pompous bastard so we can get going.~
@545=~No, wait. Let me ask some more things.~
@546=~It seems like it is.~
@547=~Not yet. I'd like to check some other things first before I make a decision.~
@548=~I am not blind in this. Yet I prove myself nonviolent. I conduct myself to all of the standards of the small people and present a precious tome from my homeland. Shall I judge you by the worst example of a <PRO_RACE> I have seen?~
@549=~The prejudice of surface dwellers is quite absolute. You'll find few exceptions.~
@550=~I agree it's unfair. Were I able to make the decisions on this, I would allow more so-called 'monster' races into our towns and cities, so long as they were peaceful.~
@551=~But you cannot just sidestep this issue. Most ogre-mages kill our people without hesitation or remorse. How is someone unaware of your intentions to know that you are different?~
@552=~The Law may not all treat us each the same, but none of us are above it.~
@553=~We all have to deal with situations in which we are judged incorrectly. By waylaying travelers, aren't you just proving correct everything they believe about you?~
@554=~You seem to be a powerful mage. Why not use some kind of illusion magic to disguise yourself?~
@555=~If you think that you can sway the Keepers where I could not, I welcome your efforts.~
@556=~Let me go speak to them. I'll return after I have.~
@557=~I may. But I'm not finished speaking with you yet.~
@558=~You speak flippantly, as if learning does not have value. Yes for one tome. A tome of most esteemed knowledge, its words bestowing power and influence beyond all reckoning. The Liberus Optimae Erositica.~
@559=~*snorted laugh* Pffftth you want -that- book? I mean... not that I've ever heard of it or nothin'.~
@560=~Ah, an esteemed librum. Perhaps you are of more culture than I thought.~
@561=~I've never heard of it. What's so important about it?~
@562=~Wait. I've heard of that one. That's a... sex manual?~
@563=~...Imoen? What's the book?~
@564=~Edwin, you know of this tome?~ 
@565=~A tome of most esteemed knowledge, its words bestowing power and influence beyond all reckoning. The Liberus Optimae Erositica.~
@566=~*snorted laugh* Pffftt you want -that- book? I mean... not that I've ever heard of it or nothing.~
@567=~Ah, an esteemed librum. Perhaps you are of more culture than I thought.~
@568=~And a law stating that one should be permitted entry when meeting certain requirements should not have unstated additional requirements. It is clear your people have no actual respect for the written laws they consider so sacred.~ 
@569=~Ok granted, laws are complicated and often arbitrary. But you should still not be doing this.~
@570=~You underestimate my patience. I have sat within a desert, staring at a mountain and watching the winds carry away grain by grain of sand until only one of us was left. My will is unbreakable.~ 
@571=~Ok, that's pretty hardcore. Maybe you -will- outlast them.~
@572=~You can't actually have done that. I don't believe it. There's no way.~
@573=~That was not my intention. I took all precautions I could to ensure their safety though... perhaps you are correct. Banditry does seem a sickness in this region now. It is possible my actions have indirectly led to death.~
@574=~Because they have not endured the trials I have to arrive here. For most, it is a simple trip from a neighboring city or nation. For me, I have crossed half the world to get here. I cannot allow this to be for waste.~
@575=~I guess you want it more, but that won't help you get in.~
@576=~No. But I will send a magical message to each of them and leave their books at the gate of the city. If your people have any honor, they will hold the books for their proper owners.~
@577=~That's reasonable, I suppose.~
@578=~Those books are definitely not getting back to their owners in that case.~
@579=~What more is there to discuss?~
@580=~Let's talk about how they refused you entry.~
@581=~Let's talk about what you want in Candlekeep. Surely there are libraries elsewhere.~
@582=~Let's talk about how you've been attacking travelers.~
@583=~It seems there will be no convincing you. I'll need to seek a solution to this elsewhere.~
@584=~I tried to reason with you, but it seems there's no avoiding violence. Prepare yourself.~
@585=~You've heard my arguments. I hope my words have swayed you on this matter, as I would hate for us to have to fight one another.~
@586=~I will remain here and await your return.~
@587=~A shame then that you are not a magister who decides the laws of the land. While I appreciate your open mindedness, it does not help either of us now.~ 
@588=~*sigh* Yeah, you're telling me.~
@589=~I am not responsible for the fears of your people. There are any number of ways for them to be assured by my attentions and I would do anything I can to facilitate it if they would let me. It is they who chose to judge based on their eyes alone.~ 
@590=~They'll never do that. You can't possibly expect it of them.~
@591=~You speak as one who needs to apologize for a system they know to be broken. Laws that do not apply equally to all are unfit to apply to any.~ 
@592=~I've struggled sometimes with the laws of my land myself, but I can't just ignore them.~
@593=~I... hm. I suppose you are not incorrect in that assessment. I wished to travel this region in peace. Perhaps I am only creating more adversity for myself.~
@594=~An imperfect solution prone to failure. Especially for one of my size, maintaining an illusion of being smaller would be difficult to focus on. And should the illusion falter before I had finished, I should not imagine what would result.~
@595=~I can see how that might put you in unnecessary danger.~
@596=~You are the lesser for it. The gifts it would impart would be a great boon for any reader.~
@597=~Well, perhaps we could find you some suitable substitute?~
@598=~Just think about how many other things there are to see on the Sword Coast! Don't you think you're being a bit narrow minded?~
@599=~But it's just a book. I grew up around thousands of them. They're a copper a dozen.~
@600=~A gross oversimplification. It is a compendium that teaches every art of carnal pleasure. The greatest repository of such knowledge on Faerun. A singular guide that contains intricate instructions on how to bring any partner to rapturous, shuddering clima-~
@601=~Alright, let me stop you there. I think I get it.~
@602=~Having such knowledge would be a great gift to my concubines. I will not return home without it.~
@603=~While no book will ever be a substitute for real thing, that does sound delightfully obscene.~
@604=~Surfacers have such volumes as well? Perhaps you are not quite as culturally impotent as I assumed.~
@605=~I doubt we'd be able to get the original for you, but there could be a copy of it somewhere.~
@606=~Just think about how many other things there are to see on the Sword Coast! Don't you think you're being a bit narrow minded?~
@607=~But it's just a book. I grew up around thousands of them. They're a copper a dozen.~
@608=~Wouldn't you rather figure out that stuff like, naturally? Reading a book feels like it's just a way to take all the fun out.~
@609=~Why settle for that information in just a book? I've heard a rumor that there's a place in Baldur's Gate where, for the right price, you can learn the same things... personally. If you catch my drift.~
@610=~No, I am not swayed by that rhetoric. Was there anything else?~
@611=~Just think about what I've said. In the meantime, I'll seek a solution to this elsewhere. I will return.~
@612=~You've heard my arguments. I hope my words have swayed you on this matter, as I would hate for us to have to fight one another.~ 
@613=~You present a compelling argument. It is something I will have to consider. What else?~
@614=~Do not patronize me. There is no suitable replacement for the Liberus Optimae Erositica. It is a one of a kind work.~
@615=~Alright alright, I guess any other book won't do.~
@616=~I have seen your Sword Coast. I am unimpressed. Perhaps I might have time after obtaining my prize that I can visit its more interesting locales.~
@617=~There's so much to see and do here you'll never experience here in the woods.~
@618=~For one who has grown up surrounded by knowledge, you fail to appreciate it. I pity your lack of curiosity.~
@619=~I've seen enough books to never want to see another one again.~
@620=~If you could find a complete reproduction... I may find that acceptable. But I have little idea of where you would begin such a search.~
@621=~Sometimes scribes who come and go from Candlekeep copy the tomes within to take out into the world. I might be able to find a scribe who has been to Candlekeep who would have it.~
@622=~*scoffs* I do not suffer from a lack of experience in this matter. But to have all of the erotic arts laid out in a single compendium? There is no experience that can match that.~
@623=~I guess I can see the appeal.~
@624=~I... does such a place truly exist? How do you know of such a thing?~
@625=~A rather worldly bard visited Candlekeep shortly before I left. She regaled me with some rather lurid descriptions of a place called the "Undercellar". She said there were courtesans there from Maztica to Kara-Tur and everywhere between, specializing in every act of love imaginable.~
@626=~I see. That could be... enlightening. Perhaps this would be worth investigating.~
@627=~I must admit, I did not expect to be swayed by the words of one sent to stop me. You truly do have a talent for persuasion, <CHARNAME>. I see clearly why my mission here was in error. I will do as you ask and leave this place.~
@628=~Here, allow me to return to you the books I have taken. I have secured them all within a bag of holding. I will leave it to you to return them.~
@629=~<CHARNAME>, do ya know what this means? We could get back inta Candlekeep! Tell 'em what happened ta Gorion or I could check in on ole Puffguts ta make sure he's doin' ok.~
@630=~...~
@631=~Ah, this is quite embarrassing.~
@632=~What? What is it?~
@633=~It appears that some magical anomaly has caused my bag of holding to have a defect. It is ah, just a bag now. An empty one, actually. Troubling.~
@634=~...nevermind. It's ok, we didn't need ta go back there anyway.~
@635=~It wasn't me this time, I swear!~
@636=~I would likely attribute this disruption to the ley lines running through the area which attracted me to this spot in the first place. Perhaps there's some latent property in them that interferes with spellcraft. Ah, a problem for another day.~
@637=~So that's it? All of the books are gone?~
@638=~Well that's great. Looks like we're not getting that full bounty now.~
@639=~One moment. There was one librum I kept to read while I waited in these forests. "The Collected Works of Salena Fairsky"? It is the last one left. Quite an entertaining read. I hope that this one will be enough for you. I would also be honored if you would take this ring, which I have found in my travels. Payment for the trouble I've caused you.~
@640=~Farewell, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps we will see one another again.~
@641=~You return. Have you yet secured me entry into Candlekeep?~
@642=~No, and I haven't decided yet. I will need to come back to you later.~
@643=~I tried to reason with you, but it seems there's no avoiding violence. Prepare yourself.~
@644=~I had actually hoped that my time away would give you an opportunity to think of what I said before. Do you feel differently now?~
@645=~You return. Have you yet secured me entry into Candlekeep? Or are we to resolve this with blood?~
@646=~I actually found a copy of the book you wanted. Here.~
@647=~What? Impossible! Let me see that.~ 
@648=~This... this is the book! The Liberus Optimae Erositica! Not the original, clearly a copy, but... it appears to be in all in tact! Excellent! I thank you for your assistance. As promised, I will be glad to leave now that I have my prize.~

// Mine Guard 1

@649=~Hells, you got here fast. You here about that robed freak? He's been patrolling around in the tunnels just past here. Be careful, he's said he'll attack anyone who intrudes on his 'domain'.~
@650=~They have just one guard stationed down here?~
@651=~Yes, I'm the exterminator. Step back, I'll take care of this.~
@652=~Yeah, it's a shite detail. Orders are to just watch this tunnel and, if I see a skeleton, run back up and let 'em know. Guess they want to ensure news doesn't get out and until this nut makes a first move, it puts us at a standoff. Good luck in there.~
@653=~Don't let me stop you. Good luck in there.~
@654=~Getting cold feet? I don't blame ya.~
@655=~Damn, you did it, didn't you? Heard the commotion and feared the worst. If I ever see you at the Belching Dragon, drinks are on me. Do you want me to escort you back up topside?~
@656=~I'd appreciate it.~
@657=~No thanks, I'll find my own way back up.~

// Mine Guard 2

@658=~You the 'exterminators' here about the 'problem'? I can guide you down below quick if you like.~
@659=~Yes, please. I've had my fill of stumbling around in the dark here.~
@660=~I'll find my own way, thanks.~
@661=~Eh? Somethin' else I can help you with?~
@662=~Could you take us down to the shaft to the third sublevel again?~
@663=~No, just checking in.~

// Illasera Companion Banters

@664=~I don't suppose that sour look on your face is intended for me, is it?~
@665=~I sense evil in you.~
@666=~And I sense... perfume on you? It’s a sickly scent, I know you’re trying to cover up the smell of sweat in that tin suit you wear, but consider a lighter application.~
@667=~I will not fall for your distraction. I beg you, reconsider the path you walk! There’s chance for redemption yet.~
@668=~It was not a distraction, it was an honest suggestion. If only you could provide me practical advice in return instead of useless preaching.~
@669=~And it's you again. Wonderful.~
@670=~Would you not at least consider doing your work in service to a lawful organization? The church has need of agents that operate more subtly and root out evil where paladins cannot easily find it.~
@671=~The only thing that makes a lawful organization such is the power for them to say so.~
@672=~You speak false! These organizations are ordained by the good gods, kings, and even the people.~
@673=~You know what sickens me most about you? The hypocrisy. You wrap yourself in moral authority simply because you uphold the status quo of those in power, while preaching to those who have been withheld power by the very same.~
@674=~No! We serve only to be examples! To show people who they can live their lives best! I don’t presume to-~
@675=~And now it is you that is being false, paladin. You presume so very much.~
@676=~Again? Have you not had your fill of me?~
@677=~Peace, Illasera. I just wished to say that I’ve been thinking on those words you spoke before about the status quo and denying power to the downtrodden.~
@678=~Tsch. Yes?~
@679=~You are right. We should do more to give to those less fortunate. I must admit that I am sometimes blinded by my pursuit of justice that I forget the virtue of compassion.~
@680=~Great. I'm so proud of you. I'll say all the prayers in thanks.~
@681=~I also am glad that your thoughts were with the less privileged. I knew there was good in you.~
@682=~Paladin, I don’t give a whit about the less privileged. I only said what I did just because I knew it would needle at you. The masses can jump into the nearest pit to the abyss for all I care.~
@683=~So you say.~
@684=~Stay away from my pockets.~
@685=~I don’t care about your pockets, silly! I was just coming to say hello. I’m Alora! I’m very very happy to meet you!~
@686=~I don’t like you already.~
@687=~Why the frowny face? Did something make you sad today?~
@688=~Yes. I met a halfling with a personality composed of cake frosting. It drove me to a murderous impulse.~
@689=~What? But cake frosting is the best part! Oh, I know what will make you happy! I’ll get you a cake. It’ll be like a birthday!~
@690=~<CHARNAME>, I need you to get this... thing... away from me. Now.~
@691=~I thought I told you to stay away from me.~
@692=~But I got you a cupcake! C’mon now, it’s got pink frosting! And sprinkles!~
@693=~I don’t care if it ha- sprinkles?~
@694=~Yup! C’mon, have a taste!~
@695=~Tsch. Fine.~
@696=~...~
@697=~The pastries of the Sword Coast are as flavorless as year old hardtack.~
@698=~Oh. Aww...~
@699=~This one is almost decent.~
@700=~Good enough for me! Yipee!~
@701=~What is it, Goldilocks?~
@702=~Forgive me for disturbing your drink, but I can feel you art a warrior-born! Have you fought in many battles?~
@703=~Yes. More than I’ve bothered to count.~
@704=~Much the same as I, though I was never so good in my numbers and counting. Tis why I answered the call of Tempus!~
@705=~Fitting. I’ve never met a priest of Tempus who was overburdened by brilliance.~
@706=~I may not be clever, but I hear well the scorn in thy voice. I bid you good day.~
@707=~To what do I owe the interest of the battle-maiden of Tempus?~
@708=~Has thou ever fought in a great melee or in a host of an army?~
@709=~Once, early in my career. Two vying merchant lords in Sembia disputed a small plot of land. They each hired an army of mercenaries to take it.~
@710=~An army? Of what size?~
@711=~There were roughly a thousand bodies on each side.~
@712=~Ah, what glory it must have been! I have longed to see such a sea of battle.~ 
@713=~I didn't see much glory in it. Just blood, bones, and excrement scattered across a blasted stretch of land. The only beauty of it I saw was that after a thousand men had died over the land, it had been utterly ruined such that neither Lord desired it anymore. The irony, that I could appreciate.~
@714=~Then it was Tempus that claimed the land that day. Mayhaps it was meant to be a lesson.~
@715=~Or maybe Tempus has a better sense of humor than I credit him.~
@716=~You’re comely and fair for a Tempus priestess. Most I’ve seen have been stockier than a dwarf and with even fuller beards.~
@717=~Watch thy tongue! Tempus may not favor you in battle for showing such insolence against his faithful.~
@718=~Then I’ll have to rely on my wits, skill, and equipment. Just as I always have.~
@719=~I don’t like the look you’re sending this way, elf.~
@720=~Forgive the offense my eyes cause you, my dear. They simply cannot escape the intoxicating beauty of your form. You would not blame a man for falling when it is gravity that propels his descent, would you?~
@721=~Then allow me to pluck them from your sockets, so that they will trouble neither of us.~
@722=~Ah, it seems I will have to learn how to fly then. For you, I would grow wings so that I might give to you the very sun.~
@723=~Perfect. That will allow me some target practice, like to a fowl scrambling to escape into the sky.~
@724=~I would gladly be your fowl. I can think of no more romantic tragedy than to have my heart pierced by your arrow.~
@725=~Oh you are relentless, aren't you?~
@726=~Guilty as charged.~
@727=~Come to fling your honeyed words at me again?~
@728=~No, I’ve decided that a black rose such as you is best appreciated from afar.~
@729=~Really? That’s it? I thought you would be more persistent.~
@730=~The whims of a romantic’s heart can be capricious and fleeting, my dear. Your beauty may be astonishing, but I’ve wit enough to realize that you’re not worth the effort.~
@731=~After speaking so longingly of my arrows piercing your heart. I’d be disappointed if I wasn’t so relieved.~
@732=~Such as it is. If you would like though, I may still be tempted to give you a quick roll in the bedsheets. It grieves me to see injury painted across those luscious lips.~
@733=~It gives me no pleasure to admit that you are *almost* as clever as you think you are.~
@734=~What is it?~
@735=~I can sense your power. It is intoxicating. Lay with me tonight. I will show you pleasures beyond any you’ve ever known.~
@736=~You're bold and straight-forward, I'll give you that.~
@737=~My confidence is well earned.~
@738=~You’re a Blackguard. Your confidence rides on the back of a dark patron. Without it, what are you?~
@739=~A strong fighter and virile lover.~
@740=~'Selfish and brutish'. No, you don't qualify as a bedmate, now begone.~
@741=~You claim to have no equal, but enslave yourself to a demon. You claim to trust no one, yet have joined a group under <CHARNAME>’s leadership.~
@742=~What is your point, woman?~
@743=~Is hypocrisy one of the guiding tenets of the Blackguards?~
@744=~Speak this way to me again, and I’ll demonstrate each of our tenets in excruciating detail.~
@745=~What is it Blackguard?~
@746=~I see through your games. You play them well, but it is not escaped my notice.~
@747=~You chide me for having a master, yet I can see your own actions are guided by another. You are no more free than I am.~
@748=~Believe as you will, Blackguard.~
@749=~You are a Wychlaran of Rashemen if I’m not mistaken.~
@750=~Thou knowest of mine order? Tis rare to see familiarity in one so far from home.~
@751=~I am from Sembia, much closer to your homeland. The exotic mysticisms of the Wychlaran intrigued me when I was young.~
@752=~Glad I am that mine order could inspire you. If thou would’st have it, I may lift the veil of mystery in thine eyes. The air is thick with rumor of the Wychlaran, seeding minds with untruth. Let mine own words dispel such nonsense.~
@753=~That may be worth the price of wine and an evening to me.~
@754=~You are here on your dajemma, correct?~
@755=~Tis Minsc’s dajemma, in specific, but the experience is one shared by both Berserker and Wychlaran.~
@756=~What is the point of it?~
@757=~To observe the lands and its people. To reflect and grow ourselves from what we learn.~
@758=~And to spy and report back to your people on what you find?~ 
@759=~Spoken uncharitably, yet not without truth. I cannot speaketh to what mine mission here is in exact, but events of great magnitude stand poised to cast from the Sword Coast.~
@760=~So what can you tell me about what you’ve seen here?~
@761=~That the smell of the land is often most foul.~
@762=~Not exactly insightful. But I’m at least relieved someone else notices.~
@763=~How can I help you, Dynaheir?~
@764=~I wish to say that I appreciate the courtesy thy have expressed mine way.~
@765=~Of course.~
@766=~However, know that I see the danger thou are, and that thy courtesy is, in part, thy way of coming close to mine confidence so that thy dagger might find an easier path to mine heart.~
@767=~Tsch. Quite shrewd. I suppose I never should have expected your confidence to be earned so easily. If it means anything, I do sincerely hope that my blade never needs to be pointed that way.~
@768=~It wouldst mean more if friendship was a ward to thy ambition.~
@769=~I suppose it was too much to ask that Thayans wouldn’t extend their tentacles even this far from their towers.~
@770=~There is no limit to the reach of the Red Wizards. Even in such provincial backwaters as these.~
@771=~You must have really pissed off someone important to be outcast this far away then. Or are you just so useless that your order could think of no better task to send you on?~
@772=~Quiet, wench! You could not conceive of the importance of my mission, even if I were to explain it as to a child.~
@773=~Is that a boisterous front to paper over your shame or are you just that deluded to think anything this far away could be worth your masters sending someone of real importance?~
@774=~Bah! None are more important than Edwin Odesseiron. (As you will learn some day soon, oh yes...)~
@775=~Yes?~
@776=~I can tell that you are a mage yourself of no insignificant talent. Where did you learn your craft?~
@777=~A school in Ordulin dedicated to the education in the magical arts. Generally for purposes of training battle mages who would serve in the mercenary armies of a given merchant lord.~
@778=~Bah! Sembia has no history or culture of magical practice. How would they know anything of the craft?~
@779=~That is true, but Sembia’s pockets run deep enough to commission mages of many different disciplines to come from abroad to teach there. I received tutoring from a dozen different mages in my time there. One of my professors was even Thayan.~
@780=~Hmm... so your education is at least only partially deficient. This scattershot method of teaching suggests several weaknesses. A focus on ‘diversity’ instead of finding one strength and honing it to optimal potency.~ 
@781=~You are not incorrect, though having numerous tutors of different magical traditions and organizations provided one other benefit.~
@782=~Which was?~
@783=~How to better kill each one.~
@784=~To what do I owe the honor, master Odesseiron?~
@785=~As one with at least a modicum of proficiency in the arcane arts, you must be familiar with the Zakharov Grimoire, yes?~
@786=~I am. It’s the tome that details Arcanic Superstring Theorem, if I remember correctly. Where do your thoughts lie on that?~
@787=~It is a brave little theory, and quite coherent if we are to suppose that material reality is rich with a half dozen dimensional layers. However, I’ve always found that these types of conjectures fail to express any kind of practical benefit. It is the condition of the Ivory Tower mage who invents answers for questions that were never asked and cannot be answered.~
@788=~Better then to study those theories that attempt to address material obstacles to overcome them, hm? I agree. A practical approach to magic will always yield superior results.~
@789=~Indeed. If you would like, we could discuss the matter further over a bottle of wine.~
@790=~I’m not sleeping with you.~
@791=~Pfah! As if I could desire anything of the sort! (Why are half-way intelligent women always so difficult?)~
@792=~You look to be missing something, Bard.~
@793=~Never you mind that. Although I am on the lookout for a paramour of mine.~
@794=~You had better find her then, and be far away from me.~
@795=~<CHARNAME>, she does raise a good point. Let us find my 'beloved', right away. Come now. (I may have more words to say to her after finding that silly girl...)~
@796=~Hmm? Why do you look at me so?~
@797=~Oh my, you are a fine woman indeed. Skin as pale as milk, hair as dark as a raven, eyes as piercing as steel. You are the very definition of dangerous beauty.~
@798=~Listen, I’m not...~
@799=~No no, do not take these words as seduction. I would dare nothing of the sort! I simply wished to compliment your form. Beauty deserves the highest flattery.~
@800=~Oh, d-do you think she looks pretty, Eldoth?~
@801=~Indeed I do, my sweet. But worry not, this is no competition. You know well how radiant a beauty yours is, that shines brighter than all others.~
@802=~Aww... I love you Eldoth~
@803=~And you are the light of my life, my dearest. Although...~
@804=~Although?~
@805=~Well, I do think that her dress is very fine. Certainly finer than your own. Her eyes are just ever slightly more striking. Her lips are fuller and more lush. She also is more, ah, how do I say it sensitively? More gifted, in the bust?~
@806=~I... oh...~
@807=~Worry not my Skie. We will simply have to purchase you some clothing and makeup that accentuates your best features, no? Then, while we are at it, we might do the same for me so as to better match you. You are still the apple of my heart, afterall.~
@808=~Oh yes! What a wonderful idea, Eldoth! We’ll do so at the very next opportunity!~
@809=~Hm. Too clever, bard. Too clever.~
@810=~Yes?~
@811=~I wonder, my dear, if you have ever thought of acquiring the services of a faithful manager?~
@812=~A manager?~
@813=~Yes yes, to attend to all the trivial matters that bog down the day to day of a busy and important woman like yourself.~
@814=~And what benefits would employing such a manager yield to me?~
@815=~Among many other things that need not be mentioned, I would attend to your schedule and finances, as well as organize your day to day and travel throughout the realms. I am also, if you would entertain a bit of boasting, a talented masseuse and am well traveled on where all the finest foods and wine may be sampled throughout the realms.~
@816=~And I suppose for your services, it’s only natural that you would take a cut of my earnings.~
@817=~You’re most perceptive, my dear. Thirty percent would be customary in such an arrangement, though for you, I would entertain as low as twenty five.~
@818=~You play your con well, but one day you will try it on the wrong woman. And when you do, not all the slime you’ve collected on yourself will help you wriggle your way out.~
@819=~Hmph. I’ll take that as a “no” on the management offer then.~
@820=~Why do you turn those beady eyes this way?~
@821=~You have the stink of civilization on you! What is that disgusting stench?~
@822=~That’s called perfume. A lovely lavender-vanilla concoction. You see, I didn’t have time to roll about in dung this morning as you did. We all have to do our best with what we have.~
@823=~Better to be covered in dung than to shroud oneself in such an unnatural scent!~
@824=~What is it this time?~
@825=~Why not return to the forests and live the way our ancestors did? You could hunt and live free.~
@826=~I think you misunderstand the city. You see it as unnatural, but I see it as the greatest and most deadly forest of them all. No wilderness hides so many knives and secrets. And I am its huntress.~
@827=~You have the fangs of a predator, but civilization has made you soft.~
@828=~Then maybe I’ll return to the forest sometime and show you first hand just how well honed my hunting skills are.~
@829=~Grrr... my favorite kind of game! Who is the wolf, and who is the hare?~
@830=~Oh not you again...~
@831=~When the moon shines in the sky! When the rain falls upon the road! I...~
@832=~Tell me bard, what happened last time you tried this on me?~
@833=~Ah, well you nocked an arrow and wondered aloud how beautifully I'd sing with it in my windpipe.~
@834=~Have you given my wondering so little thought that you would tempt me again?~
@835=~I suppose I had hoped you might have just been having a bad night. Being knocked down is only an incentive to get up and try harder next time!~
@836=~Just this once, I'll share a lesson with you. You should never practice persistence on a woman who will gut you with as little thought as she takes her breath. Do you know how you tell you are with such a woman?~
@837=~Errr... I...~
@838=~They look at you much as I’m looking at you right now.~
@839=~Now, shall I take out my bow?~
@840=~Ah n-no, that will not be necessary!~ 
@841=~I thought I made it clear what would happen if you tried wooing me again, Garrick.~
@842=~Ah, no forgive me miss Illasera, but I wasn’t! You made yourself quite clear last time, and I’d never dream of testing your patience so again! I was just... well...~
@843=~Spit it out. Your sputtering does you no favors.~
@844=~I thought I might compose a pretty song about you. If you’d allow it.~
@845=~Oh, by all that slithers in the abyss. I’ve heard you sing. You’d flatter me better if my name never graced your lips again, -especially- in song.~
@846=~I see. I apologize again. I’ll just...~
@847=~One song. A short one.~
@848=~Oh thank you! I’ll get started right now. I promise you that you’ll never hear a tale so flattering. I shall title it, “Raccoon Eyed Woman of the Night”. Oh that’s brilliant!~
@849=~...I have regrets.~
@850=~What is it this time, Garrick?~
@851=~I deeply regret to inform you that I cannot compose that song you requested.~
@852=~First of all, I never requested it. But to what do I owe this blessing?~
@853=~I could find nothing that rhymed with Illasera. Oh, I’m such a disgrace of a song-writer...~
@854=~You know songs don’t have to rhyme, don’t you?~
@855=~I don’t understand.~
@856=~Probably for the best, actually.~
@857=~What is it?~
@858=~So you’re a big shot adventurer, huh?~
@859=~I’m a Hunter. An adventurer is someone who is jobless, homeless, has a death wish, and usually suffers from several personality defects that are less cute than they believe.~
@860=~Right right. So you’ve probably been on a lot of adventures, huh?~
@861=~Is this going to have a point?~
@862=~Mmm I’m gonna become a big famous adventurer too. I was just checkin’ out yer style, see if maybe I could pick up some fashion tips.~
@863=~Right. I really don’t care. Take your ‘fashion critique’ somewhere e-~
@864=~Mmm... mmm... ya know what? Nah.~
@865=~What do you mean by that? What’s wrong with how I look?~
@866=~Oh, I mean, nothin’ really if yer tryin’ ta pull off that spooky dark ‘mistress of the night’ sorta look. You look gorgeous, really. But it’s just *way* too much black for me. I need some color in my wardrobe.~
@867=~And a cape. Capes are in right now.~
@868=~You are a very strange girl.~
@869=~Yes, what is it?~
@870=~So whatcha do for fun?~
@871=~Why do you want to know that?~
@872=~Cause I wanna ask ya on a date? Pfff, jokin', c'mon stop being difficult and answer the question!~
@873=~Fine. I enjoy reading. I like to practice my archery. I suppose I like... painting.~
@874=~Painting? Oh, that’s amazing! Could I see some of yer work?~
@875=~No. And if I catch you trying to sneak into my room to peek at any, I will string you up and make you pay for it.~
@876=~So stick ta knickin’ yer lacy underthings, got it.~
@877=~What? No!~
@878=~Oh c’mon, what harm could it be? I won’t laugh or nothin, I promise!~
@879=~Hmph. Maybe. You know I despise you giving me those puppy dog eyes.~ 
@880=~Ha! Gets ‘em every time.~
@881=~Imoen, always a pleasure.~
@882=~Hey Illy. Whatcha up ta?~
@883=~Don’t call me that.~
@884=~What? Illy? It’s perfect! You’re Illy n’ I’m Immy. It’ll be like we’re sisters!~
@885=~We are -not- sisters. Don’t be ridiculous.~
@886=~Fine, like cousins then. Maybe distant cousins so it won’t be too weird if we kiss or nothin’. Not cause I think we should, but might be nice ta keep the option open, ya know?~
@887=~Tsch. How does <CHARNAME> put up with you?~
@888=~Pfft <PRO_HESHE> wouldn’t know what ta do without me!~
@889=~I’m starting to guess that’s more true than either of you realize. Hm.~
@890=~What is it? Ya lookin' at me kinda funny, Illy.~
@891=~Imoen, I can honestly say, I’ve never met anyone so effortlessly clever as you are.~
@892=~W-huh?~
@893=~You put on this childish affectation that instantly endears you to others, but I can see how calculated it all is. You are shockingly intelligent. And that is a precious thing in this ugly world.~
@894=~Aww, ya anglin’ for that kiss afterall?~
@895=~No, no, I just... it needed to be said.~
@896=~Ya know Illasera, I think ya might be a better person than ya pretend ta be.~
@897=~Sometimes, you make me wish I was.~
@898=~Is there a reason you keep looking at me, druid?~
@899=~I should ask the same. For one who postures at being aloof and unconcerned, you pay much attention to us.~
@900=~You’re quite mistaken if you think I have any interest in you or anything about you. Don’t you have a husband to fawn over you?~
@901=~True, I can tell you care little for me. Your gaze is reserved for <CHARNAME>. What is it about <PRO_HIMHER> that interests you so?~
@902=~It seems I can hide nothing from your keen eye. Very well, I’m simply madly in love with <PRO_HIMHER>. I pray for the moment that you stop hovering so close so I can steal <PRO_HIMHER> away for a night of pure unbridled passion. After that, we will abscond beyond your motherly clutches.~
@903=~In the future, you could save some breath and both of our time to simply tell me to find the nearest chasm to jump in.~
@904=~That too.~
@905=~How difficult was it to weave your strings around <CHARNAME> hm?~
@906=~What is this about strings? You speak nonsense.~
@907=~The same strings that you dance to, played by harpists. I imagine it’s only a matter of time before you make <PRO_HIMHER> dance to them as well.~
@908=~Make your insinuations elsewhere. I have no intention of dictating <PRO_HISHER> path. I observe and counsel, never command.~
@909=~Your kind always do downplay your influence. Fine. I don't care anyway.~
@910=~You still follow <CHARNAME>, even after all this time?~
@911=~Of course. It is my duty to guide. And I care for <PRO_HIMHER> as a friend, despite any mis-steps they’ve made along the way, whatever you think.~
@912=~Perhaps I was wrong about you.~
@913=~It is too late to build bridges between us, but I accept your apology.~
@914=~Keep your distance, dwarf. Have you never heard of personal hygiene before?~
@915=~Why should I care how I smell to you? Sounds like a *you* problem to me.~
@916=~It will be a *you* problem very soon when I set your liquor-soaked beard on fire.~
@917=~So not enough to have a raging dwarf up close, you wanna have a *flaming* raging dwarf in your face? Real smart, lady.~
@918=~I have to concede that, as bad as trash smells, lighting it on fire usually just aggravates the odor.~
@919=~Kagain, how goes your business? You still run it from afar while you adventure, correct?~
@920=~Eh, it does alright. As long as bandits raid the roads, the gold stays flowin'. Then with talk of war brewing, good opportunity for more soon.~
@921=~How do you manage it so far from your offices?~
@922=~Got a niece who tends to the office. Smart girl, keeps things running just fine. I’ll have to watch her though. Anyone smart enough to count coins is smart enough to skim off the top.~
@923=~What would you do if she found out she was?~ 
@924=~I’d be proud of her, ha!~
@925=~Of course, I’d have to set an example. Can’t have anyone stealing from me. Even family.~
@926=~Yes, Kagain?~
@927=~Eh, been meaning to ask you. What’s your rate?~
@928=~Depends on the target of course. I only take on jobs that would require a significant risk and for suitable reward.~
@929=~Eh, lets just say there’s a competitor that’s been muscling in on my contracts. Merchant family in the city here. It’s their youngest son that’s spearheading the initiative. I’ve sent a few warnings, but he’s got more balls than brains. Might be someone needs to take him down a peg.~
@930=~Lets talk after this whole Iron Throne business is resolved, hm? I’ll even give you a discount if you take a bath first.~
@931=~First good reason you’ve given me yet, ha!~
@932=~What is it?~
@933=~Am I c-correct that you are both a mage as well as trained in m-martial pursuits?~
@934=~Hm. You are. Why?~
@935=~Tis only I... w-well, I thought of doing so m-myself many a times. Unfortunately I w-was never able to get the tutelage of a m-master mage to further my education. My f-family was not wealthy enough to afford those lessons to me.~
@936=~How sad.~
@937=~It was n-not so bad. I was allowed many other opp-~
@938=~Not that. What’s sad is that you didn’t have the will or courage to push past the barest resistance life gave you to take what you wanted for yourself. What’s sad is that you approach a complete stranger even now looking for validation rather than looking to improve yourself. What’s sad is...~
@939=~Hold your tongue, viper. I’ll not have you speak to my husband like this.~
@940=~...that you hide behind your wife just like you do your shield.~
@941=~I th-think I have heard enough. I’ll leave you t-to your bitterness.~
@942=~What is it this time?~
@943=~I came to r-request... nay, demand an apology. You were m-most unfair to me, last time.~
@944=~I don’t owe you or anyone else an apology. Doubly so when my words were true as I could mean them.~
@945=~Y-you don't even know who I am. I have had to f-f-fight so very dearly for what I received. With my d-difficulties, no one would give me a ch-chance unless I worked t-t-twice as hard. And even though you may not believe me, I’ll n-not be cowed by your cruel words.~
@946=~I am not afraid of you.~
@947=~Tsch. Fine. I retract my words. Well fought, soldier.~
@948=~Y-you do? Ah, I mean, thank you.~
@949=~Khalid, I have a question for you.~
@950=~Oh w-what is it?~
@951=~Given your leaner build, would you not make a more effective skirmish fighter?~
@952=~Rather than to t-t-take up the shield, you mean?~
@953=~Correct. Most shield fighters are less agile and more sturdy than you are. It seems... inefficient for you to fight as they.~
@954=~To put up a p-p-proper defense, it is important to not just be able to hold the shield steady, but to m-move it into the proper p-p-place when struck. And I am sturdier than I look. If the lives of my f-f-friends are in danger, I will not back down from anything.~
@955=~You are such an anomaly. How does a timid hearted slender elf make himself a bulwark?~
@956=~By finding love and wishing t-to protect it dearly at all costs. I hope you find the same someday.~
@957=~Damn it, I never asked for sentimental nonsense.~
@958=~What is it, ranger?~
@959=~Tell me what you know of the bandits that plague this land.~
@960=~Is that a request, or a demand?~
@961=~Call it what you will.~
@962=~Choose your words carefully. You do not *demand* anything from me. I've slain fools for less presumption than...~
@963=~I have nothing left to lose. I will give anything to exact my vengeance against the ones who took it all from me. So speak or strike me down. I do not fear you.~
@964=~Hmph.~
@965=~My sources place the two main bandit organizations operating here as the Chill and the Blacktalons.~
@966=~The Chill are a demi-human band of marauders led by the hobgoblin Ardenor Crush. Or... hobgoblin now. The rumor is he was once human, but reincarnated as a hobgoblin after his death.~
@967=~The Blacktalons are a mostly human band. Their leader is a doltish oaf named Taurgosz Khosann. His only qualification as leader is the size of the hammer he wields and how happy he is to apply it to anyone who questions him.~
@968=~Both groups number between one and two hundred. That is what I know. Now go find your vengeance.~
@969=~Thank you.~
@970=~Why do your judging eyes find me now, Ranger?~
@971=~You kill by contract. But just how discerning are you of your marks?~
@972=~Very discerning. For instance, I won’t take a contract on anyone worth less than ten thousand gold.~
@973=~Gah! That is not what I meant! Do you give no care if they are an innocent?~
@974=~An Innocent? Haven't you learned yet? There’s no such animal, ranger.~
@975=~Grrr... You disgust me.~
@976=~How has revenge suited you, dear ranger?~
@977=~Quiet! You know well that Tazok is my quarry, and he still yet breathes.~
@978=~I only wonder if even after he lies dead, that you will find the peace you seek. I don’t care if you do, but I think it’ll be fascinating to see.~
@979=~I hope one day you know what it’s like to lose a part of your very self. Perhaps then you’ll reflect upon your cruelty now.~
@980=~I’d never be so stupid as to care so much for something that could be lost in the first place.~
@981=~Bartender! Someone has allowed a rat into the inn. Take care of it at once.~
@982=~A rat? Oh ho no! This is boo! Boo is a noble hamster, warrior of justice! Say hello Boo!~
@983=~Bartender! Someone has allowed an imbecile and a rat into the inn. Take care of it at once.~
@984=~Ok, I give. What’s with the rodent?~
@985=~Rodent? Oh, do you mean Boo? Ah, appearance can fool, but these is no mere rodent. He is a miniature giant space hamster! No more noble a companion could a ranger have!~
@986=~I regret asking.~
@987=~Minsc, dear. Could you do something for me?~
@988=~Anything for good-hearted raccoon lady!~
@989=~Right. I’ve heard you’re the strongest person around, and I wanted to see. How many push ups can you do?~
@990=~Aha! Minsc is very strong and can do many many push ups! So many, he usually loses count. Boo, you must help with the counting.~
@991=~Minsc, no! Last time someone asked him to do push ups, he went on for 2 hours.~
@992=~Maybe there is some amusement to be found in the big oaf.~
@993=~I’ve noticed you doting on the necromancer. I wonder what it’s like to have to babysit a gibbering infantile maniac.~
@994=~A bit less pleasant than the feelin’ of havin’ a knife slipped into yer gut. I’ll be happy to give ye a taste to compare.~
@995=~It would be so easy to silence him for good. Just one quick stab while he sleeps. You could be free of his ravings forever.~
@996=~Speak at me no longer! I cannot bear the temptation.~
@997=~The Zhents really did send their best and brightest, didn’t they? You’re like a comedy duo, but without the laughs.~
@998=~Har har. Would ye like me to give you an autograph? I’ll be happy to carve it into yer belly. Or maybe I can give you the ole Zhentish smile, sliced molar ta molar.~
@999=~What is it?~
@1000=~Just takin’ yer measure is all. Figure me superiors’ll wanna know if there’s another player on the Sword Coast.~
@1001=~Your ‘superiors’ saw fit to send a dirty little psychopath and a madman as their envoys here. Frankly, I’m shocked the organization hasn’t burned itself to the ground.~
@1002=~Ye underestimate us as they all do, and in the end ye’ll pay the price when the piper calls.~
@1003=~Oh no, I don’t underestimate you. Any organization so volatile as that requires both eyes on them.~
@1004=~Why is the Weave so twisted? Wait, are you a...?~
@1005=~Wait wait, lemme give you a hint. It rhymes with ‘Style Sage’. Which I also kind of am!~
@1006=~Do you have any idea the damage you do to the fabric of reality just by existing?~
@1007=~Uh, yeah? Like it wasn’t drilled into me every single day in class. But what am I going to do? Just not exist?~
@1008=~It would be a kindness to everyone around you.~
@1009=~Gee well, thanks for the pep talk! I think I'll go lay in my camp bag for a bit...~
@1010=~Chaos-Mage, do you remember what I told you before?~
@1011=~Uh, nope. Definitely don’t. Especially not the part where you said I should probably just kill myself.~
@1012=~Yes, that part. I wish to amend that statement.~
@1013=~Oh great. You gonna give me some advice about what’s the best way to go? Best therapist ever.~
@1014=~No. Quite the opposite. We should all aspire to be as much of an inconvenience to existence as we can.~
@1015=~Huh?~ 
@1016=~The gods saw fit to place us on this ugly rotten world. So why should we give them the satisfaction of operating as they intended it? So go on and break the world.~
@1017=~Hey! Now that’d make for a great inspirational poster.~
@1018=~Neera, so good to see you again. Did you read the book I sent you? ‘Unstable Flows of Arcana’?~
@1019=~Oh, it was *you* who made that big tome appear in my packs? I thought I was going crazy there for a moment, or that I'd wild magic'd a book by accident.~
@1020=~Yes, I found it and it reminded me of you. I thought to send it your way and didn’t wish to wait until our paths crossed before doing so.~
@1021=~Well I gotta admit, it’s pretty neat. The way each page changes at random is a trip. I guess a book on wild magic is gonna be pretty wild like that.~
@1022=~I thought you might get some use out of it. Enjoy your reading, Weave-Ripper.~
@1023=~“Weave-Ripper”. Ok, that sounds slightly murdery, but I like it!~
@1024=~It is an... little unpleasant creature.~
@1025=~Looks can be deceiving. For you see, standing before you is a bonafide genius, just about the smartest person you’ll ever have the pleasure of meeting!~
@1026=~Is that so?~
@1027=~Indeed it is. I’ll prove it. Ask me anything. Anything at all!~
@1028=~When’s the last time you washed?~
@1029=~Oh that’s easy. 36 days and, if I read the sun correctly, 10 hours ago!~
@1030=~I would think someone smarter would remember to bathe more often. But what do I know?~
@1031=~What is it now?~
@1032=~Pop quiz time! Answer the questions as fast as you can, let's see how smart you really are!~
@1033=~I refuse to engage with this.~
@1034=~First Question, civics. What is the system of government in the country of Turmish?~
@1035=~I’m not playing this game.~
@1036=~But it’s a democratic republic.~
@1037=~Correct! Second question, geometry! A right triangle has two sides that measure 5 meters each. What is the length of the hypotenuse?~
@1038=~I told you, gnome. I am *not* playing this pointless game.~
@1039=~But the answer is seven and seven hundredths.~
@1040=~Correct! Third question, history! Name three of the seven villages who would eventually become Netheril!~
@1041=~This is ridiculous.~
@1042=~The clock is ticking! This is a timed quiz, by the way.~
@1043=~Nauseef, Gers, and Fenwick.~
@1044=~Correct! Fourth question, religion! This god is called The Lord in the Ice and is the father of giant-kin races!~
@1045=~...~
@1046=~I don't know.~
@1047=~It’s Ulutiu, you complete buffoon! Ha! Hey, but study hard and maybe you’ll ace the quiz next time!~
@1048=~Address me again and I loose an arrow through your inflated head you nasty little creature!~
@1049=~What is it?~
@1050=~You speak with so much disregard for the lives of others. How did you come to value material gains over something so precious as a life?~
@1051=~I grew up and stopped being so moronically naive about the world.~
@1052=~Life has left you jaded and closed your mind to its beauty. I will pray that one day your walls are broken down and you are again opened to wonder and hope.~
@1053=~So long as your prayers are done in silence. Don't waste my time any longer.~
@1054=~Why do you study me so, Monk? Can I not enjoy my wine in peace?~
@1055=~It is impossible not to note the subtle grace in your movements, even just to drink. You have a finesse that is remarkably second nature. Did you study in conservation of motion?~
@1056=~Not that it is of any business of yours, but I do tend to avoid unnecessary gesticulations. It is artless both in work and at rest to overextend yourself more than is necessary. Strive to achieve the most with the least energy expended.~
@1057=~It is impressive, yet I do disagree. While you may have mastered pure mechanical efficiency, it is those extra flourishes where expression materializes. Without that, we become automatons, moving only from one fixed point to another in a straight line.~
@1058=~I never imagined I’d be criticized in such a long-winded manner for the way I drink wine. Incredible.~
@1059=~I have to admit, I’ve never faced off against a Monk before.~
@1060=~Perhaps one day, we might engage in a friendly spar with one another. I always seek to enlighten of my order by example.~
@1061=~State the time and place. I will look forward to this lesson.~
@1062=~Hm?~
@1063=~So, you make your living by being a hunter of men? It seems like such a waste. A woman of your talents and beauty could do more with so much less work.~
@1064=~I imagine you have difficulty conceiving of any living not earned on your back.~
@1065=~Ooo catty. You and I, we could make a show of it and clean out the pockets of the whole bar.~
@1066=~Shall I strip you nude and whip you for the amusement of the crowd?~
@1067=~I thought you might be fun! Mmm, not a vision suitable for this rabble, but I hope you’ll keep that riding crop of yours ready for when I find a patron worthy (and wealthy) enough for such a rare performance.~
@1068=~I... could be convinced.~
@1069=~Yes, Safana?~
@1070=~Illasera, just the woman I desire. You remember that offer I made to you when we last spoke?~
@1071=~I do. Don’t tell me you...~
@1072=~I did. A very wealthy noble with certain predilections. He awaits very close by and is happy to provide a plump bag of gold to make his fantasies come true.~
@1073=~And he is just to watch as we... play out his fantasy?~
@1074=~Mmhm. Trust me, dear, you’ll have so much fun. And your purse will be very pleased for it too.~
@1075=~Hmm. Very well. Show me there.~ 
@1076=~This... this is wrong. I will need to uh p-pray on this tonight.~
@1077=~While the idea is intriguing, I’m not one for sitting and watching. Do enjoy yourselves, ladies.~
@1078=~Even the most banal of carnal acts among the drow are treated with such exoticism and reverence here. It’s so tiresome.~
@1079=~Uh, right. I just realized there’s somewhere I also uh, gotta be. I better go take care of that.~
@1080=~Right this way, my dark mistress.~
@1081=~You're right, that was rather enjoyable. I was never much for theater, I hope I performed adequately?~
@1082=~You did fantastically, dear. Are you certain you've never done that before? It felt like you've had quite a lot of experience at... punishment.~
@1083=~I suppose my talents in 'information extraction' translated especially well.~
@1084=~I’m coincidentally also back from that thing I went ta do. That thing that had nothing ta do with whips and collars.~
@1085=~I'm glad you were able to restrain yourself, although umf... only barely just.~
@1086=~I did not strike you too hard, did I?~
@1087=~Mmph, you did get into the role. I thought at a few points I might actually have 'displeased' you. It's only a few bruises and some soreness for a day or two, well worth it. I’m tougher than I look, and our patron was so very pleased.~
@1088=~Then I hope a tribute of wine will soothe your aches. Let us celebrate a successful business partnership, and perhaps more in the future.~
@1089=~What is the next scheme brewing in that pretty head of yours, Safana?~
@1090=~It involves a love-lorn young noble who finds an exotic foreign girl who reignites his passions again. Only for her to be so cruelly kidnapped by a raven-haired villainess who demands a healthy ransom for her safety. However, shortly after the ransom is paid, the foreign girl absconds away, never to be seen again! How does that pique your interests?~
@1091=~It’s an interesting sport, but I’ve got a far larger idea in mind.~
@1092=~Oh, is that so? Do tell.~
@1093=~It’s too soon to share just yet. But rest assured, I will steal you away for the details in time.~
@1094=~As always, Illasera dear, I await breathlessly.~
@1095=~Girl, come here a moment.~
@1096=~Call me girl again and I’ll run you through!~
@1097=~Of course. Apologies. I was simply... hm, examining you. You’ve intense eyes and a savage countenance. I can tell you’re a very strong woman.~
@1098=~Strong enough to kill any man who’d underestimate me. But I don’t care for your scrutiny, so you’d better have a point to this.~
@1099=~I just think you might be quite special. The rare sort who’d thrive as a Hunter, as I am.~
@1100=~Do you get to gut anyone you please?~
@1101=~Not anyone. But more than enough to satisfy any killer's bloodlust.~
@1102=~Hmph! I might think about it. But for now, get out of my face.~
@1103=~How did you become a killer, Shar-Teel?~
@1104=~One of my pig-father’s associates tried to fondle me and pull me into his lap when I was twelve summers of age. So I drove Mister Stabby into his groin and up through his belly, then watched him bleed to death just as dear old dad taught me.~
@1105=~Mister Stabby?~
@1106=~Yeah, so I gave my first knife a name, what of it? I didn’t exactly grow up with dolls.~
@1107=~No, it’s actually rather adorable. Do you still name your weapons?~
@1108=~Of course not. That’s peak male foolishness. My sword is a tool I use to slay my enemies. Not some kind of... phallic totem that needs to be recognized.~
@1109=~How about 'Mister Stabby', do you still keep it?~
@1110=~Of course, right in my boot. Best friend a woman can have.~
@1111=~What can I help you with, Shar-Teel?~
@1112=~I’ve thought about what you said before. About becoming a hunter.~
@1113=~Have you? And what have you decided?~
@1114=~When my debt to <CHARNAME> is done, I will find and join you. You’re the type of smart, pragmatic leader that can get things done.~
@1115=~I’m glad to hear it. I think you’ll be very excited by the plans I have.~
@1116=~There better not be too many idiot men in this arrangement!~
@1117=~A few men, but I think you’ll be quite pleased by what I have in mind. We’ll speak on it later.~
@1118=~What are you staring at?~
@1119=~I was just... well, you’re so refined and elegant. Are you from a noble family yourself?~
@1120=~I am the orphan bastard child of a destitute madwoman. What refinement and wealth I have was earned through trial and pain, not given to me by wealthy parents.~
@1121=~Oh... I-I see.~
@1122=~...~
@1123=~You may leave now.~
@1124=~Yes, uh, thank you.~
@1125=~What is it?~
@1126=~Oh Illasera, do you have a brush?~
@1127=~A brush? I do?~
@1128=~Oh, you are a life saver! My own broke the other day and I’ve got such bad tangles that refuse to be tamed. If I could just have it a moment...~
@1129=~No. I’ll not have your dull hair tangled in the bristles. Go beg one of your babysitters for one.~
@1130=~Oh... ok. S-sorry.~
@1131=~Honestly, <CHARNAME>, why do you let her tag along with you? It is confounding.~
@1132=~Ah, if it isn’t the Flaming Fist’s most distinguished and frequent guest.~
@1133=~Yes, it is I, Tiax! Tiax has decided that the accommodations of that building are no longer suitable to hold his grandeur! These minions now serve at his leisure, and will aid in his ascent to godhood!~
@1134=~Is that so? Well, <CHARNAME>, I do hope you know what you’ve signed up for with this one.~
@1135=~Oh great Tiax, what is your will?~
@1136=~Tiax demands sacrifices! You there! Have you made a sacrifice to gain Tiax’s favor this day?~
@1137=~Of course, Tiax. I drove a blade into a babe’s heart just this morning and prayed for Tiax to grant me favor.~
@1138=~Most excellent! And his favor you shall have. Bend low so that he might draw his mark on your head, that all shall see and know your service!~
@1139=~No, I don’t think so.~
@1140=~What?! You DARE refuse?~
@1141=~Oh of course not Tiax, I simply think that your humble servants must remain hidden, so that they can better dispose of his enemies.~
@1142=~Hmm... his servant does bring up a good point. Very well, continue your service to Tiax in secret. I expect another sacrifice soon. And more plainly, so that Tiax may watch.~
@1143=~A drow here on the surface? Curious.~
@1144=~Better curiosity than the scorn I receive from most surfacers. Can they not see I simply wish to make my way in peace? I don’t wish to hurt anyone!~
@1145=~Drop the woebegone pitiful maiden act. It might work on fools enchanted by your dark beauty, but I know deadly nightshade when I see it.~
@1146=~Fine. So you’re slightly more perceptive than most surfacer fools. Do you now seek to rip out my black heart from my breast?~
@1147=~I only seek the hearts of those who matter. You, my dusky runaway, don’t.~
@1148=~*mutters* Shar, grant me power to endure the barbed tongues of ignorant surface filth.~
@1149=~What is it, drow?~
@1150=~Tell me, have you heard of any contracts for my life?~
@1151=~Do you mean contracts from below that might be pursuing you, or someone who has noticed you on the surface and wishes your death for your very nature?~
@1152=~Ether one, damn you!~
@1153=~Tsch, so impatient. The answer to both is “no”. You've kept your profile low enough on the surface to not attract much attention. It just so happens I have a duergar contact below that specializes in writs for runaways. Nothing has been sent my way that would match your description.~
@1154=~Good. That is at least a small relief. Perhaps they think I am dead.~ 
@1155=~Or they may be waiting to see if the surface finishes you off.~
@1156=~I’m surprised to see that you still wander on the surface with <CHARNAME>.~
@1157=~Where else can I go? This group affords me protection and opportunity. It’s a beneficial arrangement.~
@1158=~Will you still stay when that arrangement no longer benefits you?~
@1159=~Of course not. I have no love for any of them. Survival is the only thing that matters. I will do anything to ensure mine. I can already tell that my time here comes to a close. I will venture off to seek darker refuge elsewhere soon.~
@1160=~Maybe you will last longer than I ever thought you would. I wish you skill and cunning in your journeys.~
@1161=~What is it?~
@1162=~You take great pains to hide your elvish heritage.~
@1163=~I couldn’t possibly know what you’re talking about.~
@1164=~The way you wear your hair hides your ears. Then the manner of your dress. Baggy clothing that conceals your form, dyed in tenebrous hues uncommon to fair elvish folk.~
@1165=~Elf-blood attracts attention and assumption. I hardly see why it matters to you.~
@1166=~Little matters to me anymore. My one glowing beacon in the endless night of existence is thoughts of my people and home.~
@1167=~We have no kinship, Greycloak.~
@1168=~No, I suppose not. But it only deepens my melancholy to see a child of the Seldarine drifted so far away.~
@1169=~Xan, I wonder what your field of specialization is as a mage.~
@1170=~I am an Enchanter, if it really matters.~
@1171=~Seriously?~
@1172=~You probably find this preposterous.~
@1173=~Usually Enchanters are more... charming.~
@1174=~My expertise comes in the pitch of my voice and my gentle slow movements. Some might call it lethargic. But in battle, they combine to create a hypnotic effect.~
@1175=~Xan is the best at telling bedtime stories. Puts ya right ta sleep.~
@1176=~Xan, I must concede that you very well may be an interesting person despite yourself.~
@1177=~Wonderful. I strive to make a *yawn* impression.~
@1178=~Xan, a question for you.~
@1179=~What would you like to know?~
@1180=~Do you believe that the ends justify the means?~
@1181=~What a very broad question. I don’t suppose I can expect your reason for asking me it, nor for any specifics or context?~
@1182=~You cannot.~
@1183=~Then my answer is this: No, it is not. The ends are defined by the means and no compromise made to reach the end comes without a cost to it. Anyone who denies that fact is fooling themselves.~
@1184=~Hmph...~
@1185=~Does my answer disappoint you?~
@1186=~Would it be you if it didn’t?~
@1187=~I’m glad we understand each other.~
@1188=~Madness is either an affliction or a veil. Which is it with you, mage?~
@1189=~Mad, me? No no it could not be further from the truth. If my words fail me, tis only because I speak too many truths for simpering minds to comprehend.~
@1190=~It has to be at least partially true. Faking mad ravings is easy enough. But nobody can fake the eyes.~
@1191=~Eyes? Oh, my very favorite subject! Shall we discuss methods of extraction? Or how to properly squeeze the jelly from them? Delectable, delicious jelly... but you musn’t sup on it, no dear not before you finish dinner...~
@1192=~A waste of my time either way.~
@1193=~What is it, madman?~
@1194=~Hold that expression a moment. Yes, the one of unfathomable irritation right there. Yes yes, I recognize you now. A frequent visitor to the Keep! We should be such friends!~
@1195=~Dealing with the Zhents was always simply a partnership of convenience. I’d no more befriend a Zhent than I would a snake.~
@1196=~Tis your loss. I've known snakes that would regale me for hours with their tales. And their venom is quite useful as well.~
@1197=~Will you be returning to your homeland after the Iron Throne has been dealt with?~
@1198=~I can scarcely think whyfor! The Sword Coast has proven such a boon to my complexion, and the people here have been... scrumptious.~
@1199=~The Zhents have you on entirely too loose of a leash.~
@1200=~One does not cage a majestic bird, slattern! I have much more to do here yet, oh yes.~
@1201=~Rieltar’s dwarf, here? How fascinating.~
@1202=~Speak not the name of that fiend! Betrayer of friendship, my hammer’s got a few words to speak with him!~
@1203=~He always was good at ensnaring the trust of the hopelessly naive. Don’t feel too sore about it, dwarf.~
@1204=~He’ll be the sore one, soon enough!~
@1205=~*yawns*~
@1206=~...and it was then that my great grandfather Khever Orothiar found his way through the Cloakwood with our clan. On a spot by the river, the mountain there had a wealth of iron that would form the backbone of our family for ages to come. And that is how Clan Orothiar settled into the Cloakwood mines.~
@1207=~Eh, have I lost ye? Are ye listening?~
@1208=~I never invited you to even start your tale. I’m not sure why you were even speaking it to me.~
@1209=~Youngins these days, no respect for their elders!~

@1210=~Finally, someone shuts that pissant farmer up. The Grand Dukes should award you a medal.~ 
@1211=~I didn't mean to. He forced my hand. Gods, if only he would have listened.~
@1212=~Just doing my part to rid the world of one more ignorant yokel.~
@1213=~I'm not proud of my actions here, but you should not make light of the man's death.~
@1214=~Yes? If you don't have business with me, I suggest you move on. I've little interest in indulging a group of ragtag farmers playing at being adventures.~ 
@1215=~Well isn't she just a bright ray of sunshine. I thought these small towns would be friendlier.~
@1216=~And aren't you so... pink.~
@1217=~Forgive me. You just looked interesting. It's rare to find someone with gear as fine as yours in such a small town.~
@1218=~And yet you haunt the inn of a farming community. It seems if you have such an aversion to simple people, you could choose a better place to drink.~
@1219=~How can I know if I have business with you if I don't know who you are? Perhaps we could trade names and decide what business we have after?~
@1220=~Gods, what bit your arse on the way out of bed this morning?~
@1221=~You could find no better way to subdue an unarmed peasant than spilling his guts on the bar floor?~
@1222=~She is not incorrect. <CHARNAME>, this was quite a serious lapse of judgment.~
@1223=~Unarmed he may have been, but he was large as an ox and presented a danger. I'm sorry it happened this way, but I won't apologize for defending myself.~
@1224=~I wasn't thinking, I just reacted. He was dead before I even realized what happened.~
@1225=~My anger got the better of me. I will have to try to do better in the future.~
@1226=~Aren't you a bloodthirsty pup? It's almost adorable. I respect a vicious streak, but know when to rein it in. Baring your teeth might scare the locals, but an experienced killer won't confuse a whelp for an alpha.~
@1227=~Everyone's gotta sleep sometime. A dagger in the bedchambers'll bring low peasant and king alike.~
@1228=~Another murderous little cretin? The Sword Coast must breed them like flies.~
@1229=~And I take it that you are that alpha?~
@1230=~T'was only a jest! I figured you'd get a laugh from it.~
@1231=~That sounded like a threat. I don't much care for threats.~
@1232=~If the gods did not intend death to be funny, then they would not allow people to die in such amusingly ironic ways.~
@1233=~Tis true tis true! In every skull is a rictus grin. A most hilarious joke in the telling. I once witnessed a plague ravage through a town and was perfectly useless with laughter for days. Those bastards will pay for the time they robbed me!~
@1234=~Keep the madman away. I have little patience for his kind.~
@1235=~Do not blame the gods for your sick sense of humor.~
@1236=~You speak as though you're above all of it. Would you feel the same if you were the one to perish?~
@1237=~I guess it was a little funny... in a macabre sort of way.~
@1238=~Yes yes, I'm sure I'm quite the fascination. What is it you want?~
@1239=~Who are you?~
@1240=~What are you doing here?~
@1241=~Uhh... where'd you get all that shiny gear?~
@1242=~You know what? Nevermind. You obviously don't want me talking to you.~
@1243=~Full of pedantic observations, aren't you? I am here because it serves my purpose and is the least awful of the options I have available to me.~
@1244=~Well, what is it you are doing here then, if I might ask?~
@1245=~I imagine it must be a good reason to bring someone of such obvious esteem here as you, m'lady. May I inquire as to who you are? Is there anything I might assist you with?~
@1246=~There's always the Friendly Arm to the north of here.~
@1247=~*snort* Oh, that's precious. Listen, I've dealt with quite enough two-faced lovelorn bards trying to woo me out of my underclothes. I'm not interested.~
@1248=~Ah, <CHARNAME>, I am afraid it's true. Not even the ballad of Trysts under Dark could sway her.~
@1249=~Bard, if I catch you so much as-~
@1250=~No, not in the face again! Y-you won't so much as hear another peep out of me I promise!~
@1251=~It wasn't my intentio-~
@1252=~Ah well, can't fault me f-~
@1253=~Now listen here. I'm just tr-~
@1254=~Nor should you. But don't be ashamed of your actions. You obviously carry a penchant for violence in you. Accept it. Own it. You'll live the happier for it.~
@1255=~A sentiment that I am certain Gorion would not share. <CHARNAME>, I would advise that you do not listen to this woman.~
@1256=~We are not so d-defined by what we are. Far more important be the th-things we do.~
@1257=~Or listen to mommy there. I care not.~
@1258=~Perhaps there is some wisdom in what you say.~
@1259=~That's not true. Don't presume you know anything about me.~
@1260=~Can't say. I'm still unsure who I am. I just hope I can discover myself in my travels.~
@1261=~Your definition of greatness is abhorrent. Whatever my 'nature' is, I'll mold it to fit my own morals and live a just life regardless.~
@1262=~That's because you carry a penchant for violence in you. Do not be ashamed of it. Accept it. Own it. You'll live the greater life for it.~
@1263=~Hmph. Some of us carry violence and death in our blood. I fail to see how rejecting your fundamental nature will lead to anything 'better'. At best, it's the path to a hollow existence. Accept it. Own it. You'll live the greater life for it.~
@1264=~To you? Please. I don't think I really need to answer that.~
@1265=~You do look rather experienced, I'll give you that. So who are you and what are you doing here?~
@1266=~I'm no whelp. Underestimate me at your own peril.~
@1267=~A minor victory then for bringing this bit of excitement to an otherwise tedious day.~
@1268=~If I've earned your favor, perhaps you might tell me who you are or what brings you here today?~
@1269=~It's my pleasure to bring a little light into your life. Now then, I should be taking my leave.~
@1270=~Poor cub. I'm sure you'll be able to find plenty of gibberlings outside of town to vent your frustrations on. Now, if you are done here?~
@1271=~Heh, you might as well quit your whining <CHARNAME>. You don't seem to be impressing her.~
@1272=~Fine. But this won't be the last you hear of me, I assure you.~
@1273=~No. You will tell me who you are and what you are doing here.~
@1274=~Well, you're certainly the life of the party, aren't you? Now then, if you're quite done hovering around me...~
@1275=~Fine. It seems you want little to do with me. I will take my leave.~
@1276=~One thing. I am still curious about who exactly you are and what brings you here.~
@1277=~Of course. I must simply endeavor not to die in such a moronic fashion. It shouldn't prove too difficult. Now then, if you're quite done hovering around me...~
@1278=~Fine. It seems you want little to do with me. I will take my leave.~
@1279=~One thing. I am still curious about who exactly you are and what brings you here.~
@1280=~Some say that it is only by laughing in the face of death can you ever have any true mastery over it. Of course, those people are fools of little aspiration but they're at least partially correct.~
@1281=~And what's your philosophy for facing death?~
@1282=~Well this has been "pleasant". I should take my leave.~
@1283=~None of your concern. I am not in the business of divulging information to those who have no need of it. Begone.~
@1284=~Although, perhaps... Hold a moment.~
@1285=~What is it?~
@1286=~Uh, can you make up your mind?~
@1287=~Hmph. Hold a moment.~
@1288=~What I need now is hardly a tour guide of the Sword Coast. Thank you but I'm where I need to be. Now begone.~
@1289=~Now now, cease your sputtering. Hmph. I wonder something.~
@1290=~You know, I am getting some really mixed signals here.~
@1291=~Don't just take my word for it. Live your life day by day and you will see for yourself. There's no wisdom better than experience.~
@1292=~Hmph. Fine. Fight it all you like. But you'll see for yourself, in time. There's no wisdom better than experience.~
@1293=~I underestimate nobody. No, I think I have you rather exactly estimated. Now then, go pick a fight somewhere else. I've no interest in washing the bar floor with your entrails.~
@1294=~That's personal. Don't take my advice as an offer of friendship.~
@1295=~You have the look of an adventurer. Fresh out from behind your mother's skirt, but I still see the undeniable spark of it. I think I can be of help to you.~
@1296=~Yup, we're adventurers alright. Off on the adventure of a lifetime. It's been pretty fun so far. Well, except for all the bad stuff, of course. Long marches, sleepin' on rocks, never gettin' ta take a bath, n' all the rest.~
@1297=~An adventurer by necessity more than will, but I suppose so.~
@1298=~I don't know what I am. I just know that my problems won't be solved by hiding in some cottage or tavern.~
@1299=~I am. Someday I will be a great adventurer, even.~
@1300=~Adventure? Pfah! I'm a <PRO_MANWOMAN> with a mission and I will not allow anyone to get in my way.~
@1301=~I see. Return to me after you've made a bit of a name for yourself in the region. I have an opportunity I can offer you, but it's not something I can give to just any neophyte with a rusty sword and a basic spellbook.~
@1302=~You're testing us? For what purpose? You seemed to have nothing but contempt a moment ago.~
@1303=~Not a test. An opportunity. I offer the terms of qualification. This is not specifically about you or your group.~
@1304=~A name for myself? What do you mean?~
@1305=~Ok. I will return to you once my name graces the lips of the common folk.~
@1306=~I may, I may not. I cannot make any promises.~
@1307=~What could you possibly have to offer me?~
@1308=~When you have a reputation among the people here. The opportunities I offer only exist for those who have proven their name has worth. I hear that the mines down south in Nashkel are experiencing some problems. I am sure resolving those would do well to spread your fame. Do take care not to die pitifully in the dark down there.~
@1309=~I was headed just that way regardless. I suppose I will return after. Until then, I bid you farewell.~
@1310=~We'll see. I care not for my reputation, but it may grow regardless.~
@1311=~I hear that the mines down south in Nashkel are experiencing some problems. I am sure resolving those would do well to spread your fame. Do take care not to die pitifully in the dark down there.~
@1312=~Curious, are you? Do what I ask, and I will sate your curiosity. I cannot tell you more, but just know it will benefit you.~
@1313=~A dreadful premonition of a witless cow bumping into my table and disturbing me with inane comments. Ah, it seems that perhaps I should have pursued the life of a seer.~
@1314=~I'd rather get a slap in the face than have you read my palm. Although I suppose you'd fit the cliché of the prickly witch, exiled to a mountaintop.~
@1315=~Listen, maybe we're getting off on the wrong foot here. I didn't mean to intrude. Maybe if you could simply tell me who you are, we could go from there.~
@1316=~Fine, I'm leaving. No need to get your underclothes in a twist.~
@1317=~I'd not touch your face except with my boot. Though the more I look at it, the more I think an arrow would suit it better.~
@1318=~Do you two need to like... go somewhere or...?~
@1319=~At least I do not aspire to appear like a raccoon. Or has your constant glaring caused your eyes to recede so far back into your head that the light will not follow?~
@1320=~Listen, maybe we're getting off on the wrong foot here. I didn't mean to intrude. Maybe if you could simply tell me who you are, we could go from there.~
@1321=~Fine, I'm leaving. No need to get your underclothes in a twist.~
@1322=~You... hmph. Perhaps you have more wit than it would appear. I won't fault you for being a coward, at least.~
@1323=~You know, I am getting some really mixed signals here.~
@1324=~Well this has been "pleasant". I should take my leave.~
@1325=~I believe I have already made it clear that I have nothing else to say to you right now. Go down to Nashkel and fight whatever demons or gibberlings plague them. You won't make a name for yourself here unless your aspirations begin and end at being the village idiot. You'll find fierce competition for that role.~
@1326=~Well well, if it isn't <CHARNAME>, come to bask in the adulation of the masses. Perhaps to enjoy a few complimentary rounds bought by your admirers, or a blushing star-struck lad or lass to warm your bed.~
@1327=~Aha! We've come to have a good drink and share stories just as the mighty warriors do in the Ice Dragon Berserker's Lodge!~
@1328=~More likely to bask in the heat of the fire and reflect on our depressingly imminent mortality.~	
@1329=~Sorry, do I know you?~
@1330=~I wouldn't say my actions have received that much attention.~
@1331=~If only. You'd think saving the livelihood of a significant portion of the south would earn me a little more respect.~
@1332=~Of course, where are my manners? Allow me to introduce myself.~
@1333=~I am Illasera the Quick, of Sembia. There I am known as a bounty hunter of no minor notoriety. Of course, it takes more than placating a few miners to earn a respected name in the Eastern Heartlands.~
@1334=~And that name would be as dirt in Thay. Spare us your thinly veiled condescension.~
@1335=~Well met Illasera, though I cannot help but feel your mocking tone.~
@1336=~Has anyone ever told you that you're kind of a bitch?~
@1337=~And what have I done to earn your attention?~
@1338=~Not yet, but word travels fast in the circles I keep. It moves slower for simple farming folk, but they too will hear in time.~
@1339=~Allow me to introduce myself. I am Illasera the Quick, of Sembia. There I am known as a bounty hunter of no minor notoriety. Of course, it takes more than placating a few miners to earn a respected name in the Eastern Heartlands.~
@1340=~Have patience. Most farmers and peasants live their lives with their heads planted into the ground, ignorant to the world. But even they hear the rumbling of those who truly shake the earth.~
@1341=~Ah, but I'm being melodramatic. Allow me to introduce myself; I am Illasera the Quick, of Sembia. There I am a bounty hunter of no minor notoriety. Of course, it takes more than placating a few miners to earn a respected name in the Eastern Heartlands.~
@1342=~You musn't take it personally. I've been told my manner can certainly be... prickly. If I didn't like you, you'd certainly know it.~
@1343=~How would I know that?~
@1344=~I've dealt with stern monks and librarians with sticks up their arse my whole life. I can deal with you. Speak what you want of me.~
@1345=~I have an opportunity I would like to share with you. You have demonstrated you are not afraid to delve into the unknown and have at least a modicum of talent at dealing with 'problems' with appropriate force.~
@1346=~You speak as a viper; evasively and with venom behind your lips. Why should we trust what you have to say?~
@1347=~Because one does not become a successful adventurer by passing on opportunities, however personally you dislike my tone. Consider it a leap of faith.~
@1348=~Problems?~
@1349=~Alright. Lets hear it. What would you like me to do?~
@1350=~I don't much care for your tone and I am suspicious of whatever it is you have to offer. I'll pass.~
@1351=~You might be dead, for one. Or in such pain that there would be no confusing the matter.~
@1352=~Right... well anyway, what do you want with me?~
@1353=~I'm just going to stop you right there. Whatever you have to say, I'm not interested.~
@1354=~People, generally. Creatures, often enough.~
@1355=~We are not assassins for hire, or at least I would hope not. Right, <CHARNAME>?~
@1356=~I would not define the types of jobs I am about to offer you as 'assassinations', although killing will certainly be requried.~
@1357=~Ok then, speak plainly. What are you offering me?~
@1358=~I don't much care for your tone and I am suspicious of whatever it is you have to offer. I'll pass.~
@1359=~A foolish choice. Perhaps I was wrong about you. Fine, wander about the Realms until you stumble into an assassin's blade or fall into a pit and die. I've my own business to attend to.~
@1360=~Pray that we do not meet again, <CHARNAME>~
@1361=~As I mentioned, I am a bounty hunter. Even this far from home, I have my contacts and am often informed of bounties far before they hit the local boards. Yet, the bounties thus far have proved...~
@1362=~Let's just say, below my payrate. And besides, I have other priorities while I'm here. I can't go gallivanting about, hunting down small time criminals or pillaging demihumans.~
@1363=~But why should I allow an opportunity slip through my fingers when I could pass it on to an aspiring young adventurer, looking to make their mark on the Realms as well as earn no small amount of gold?~
@1364=~Yet you work for no lawful enforcement organization? I don't much like the sound of this! <CHARNAME>, I fear this could be vigilantism at best!~
@1365=~I see. What would be my pay for pursing these on your behalf?~
@1366=~So am I supposed to just do your bounty work for you? I hardly see how that's much of a benefit to me.~
@1367=~An interesting proposition. Alright, how do we start?~
@1368=~Are my companion's concerns valid? Are these jobs might involve actions that would fall outside of the law?~
@1369=~Tsch, paladins. As if the law was concerned with the good of people living in these backwaters. But no, if it's so important, I will not be asking you to pursue anything that would be flagrantly illegal or put you at odds with the Flaming Fist or other "lawful" organizations of the land.~
@1370=~Hm. Thank you <CHARNAME> for following up with her on this. So long as these jobs of hers serve the greater good, I suppose I can see no harm in them. Perhaps we might even be able to use this chance to find those who have escaped lawful retribution and ensure they face Helm's judgment.~ 
@1371=~What would be my pay for pursing these on your behalf?~
@1372=~So am I supposed to just do your bounty work for you? I hardly see how that's much of a benefit to me.~
@1373=~An interesting proposition. Alright, how do we start?~
@1374=~Dependent on the bounty, obviously. As for your cut, I'd say that an eighty-twenty split in your favor would be more than fair. You are doing the work, after all. I will provide the bounties as well as any intel I've gathered on them.~
@1375=~Ya think we're suckers? We'll do it for ninety percent of the cut. I won't do someone else's hard work while they're sitting in a posh tavern gettin' a foot massage.~
@1376=~The split is non-negotiable. It will be eighty-twenty or this conversation dies here.~
@1377=~Eh, I tried. It's actually a pretty good offer <CHARNAME>, I'd take thirty in the same position.~
@1378=~And what's to stop me from just waiting until the bounties are posted publicly and taking them on at full price?~
@1379=~That sounds fair. How do we get started?~
@1380=~No, I don't think I much care for the sound of this. I'll pass.~
@1381=~Fortune and experience, which are invaluable assets to anyone new to the adventuring profession. I offer a fair cut on lucrative contracts. An eighty-twenty split in your favor. I'm sure you can squeeze them in between whatever else you are doing.~
@1382=~A word of advice. The best bounty hunters never wait for official postings. In this business, you have to be ahead of the game at all times, or someone else will collect first or the target will slip away. I'm offering the edge you need to get the targets before anyone even knows of them. And don't underestimate the information I can provide. Intel is a hunter's most valuable tool.~
@1383=~And so <PRO_HESHE> returns. I heard that an ambitious young adventurer named <CHARNAME> had caused quite a stir in the south and thought, why that must be the <PRO_MANWOMAN> I met the other day.~
@1384=~Come to bask in the adulation of the masses? Perhaps to enjoy a few complimentary rounds bought by your admirers, or a blushing star-struck lad or lass to warm your bed?~
@1385=~Hardly. You asked me to come back once I'd dealt with the issues in Nashkel. I've come to see what you have to offer.~
@1386=~I wouldn't say my actions have received that much attention.~
@1387=~I'm glad you remembered. A smart decision, I'm sure you'll see.~
@1388=~Well met Illasera. I see our time apart has not soothed your mocking tone.~
@1389=~Hmph. I'd had hoped you might have become slightly less awful in the meantime.~
@1390=~So what did you want to offer me?~
@1391=~An easy one to begin with. It seems that the local bar, the Burning Wizard, received the patronage of a band of unruly adventurers.~
@1392=~In their drunken binge, they broke several tables and chairs, defaced the walls, and injured several of the other patrons. One person died from his wounds before a priest could arrive.~
@1393=~Oh no, I hope that that the drinking table with the gryphon engravings is ok. It was a striking piece of furniture.~
@1394=~Uh, Garrick, she said somebody died. Don'tcha think that's a bit more important than a table?~
@1395=~Oh yes! Right you are! Very tragic. Perhaps I should offer to compose a dirge for the funeral. Or... would that be too depressing? Ah, I could sing love ballads to lift their spirits instead!~
@1396=~Yer an odd duck, Gare-bear.~
@1397=~Heh, sounds like they had a great time.~
@1398=~Those fiends. They should be brought to justice.~
@1399=~Who put up the bounty?~
@1400=~Isn't that something better handled by the guards?~
@1401=~Who are these rowdy adventurers, exactly?~
@1402=~A foolish lapse of discretion. Young adventurers are so often the same. They think themselves able to take on the world and be immune to the consequences.~
@1403=~Tis a l-lesson we should take to heart. S-so often r-revelry can get out of hand.~
@1404=~A fine time may have been had, but they'd have done better to leave no witnesses.~
@1405=~So what's the pay and how do I get started?~
@1406=~If you wish them to face justice, their fate is in your hands now. You are judge, jury, and most importantly, executioner in this manner.~
@1407=~So I am to kill them? Their crimes seem evident, but death is a strong sentence.~
@1408=~The family of the boy that was killed. Paupers, but well enough loved by their neighbors that they could raise a small sum of money to contract the services of at least novice bounty hunters. The bar pitched in as well.~
@1409=~How many guards have you seen in town? Beregost is halfway between Amn and Baldur's Gate, and enjoys the protection of neither. It has no policing force besides a scant volunteer militia. No, this town depends on a little 'frontier justice' to deal with criminals.~
@1410=~You are to deal with them. Beregost has no court or prison. Are you going to march them north to Baldur's Gate, where they've broken no laws and will likely be let out by an uncaring magister? Can you even get into Baldur's Gate currently?~
@1411=~Besides, I doubt this group has the temprement to surrender without a fight. Go and confront them and make your decision then. Perhaps a creative solution will present itself to you. I doubt it, but it's your mission to execute.~
@1412=~The lowest dregs of adventuring. In nearly every tavern across the face of Faerun, at one point or another, there has come together a few hopeful individuals of varied talents, looking to put their mark on the world. They form together and seek out danger and fame.~
@1413=~Then there are those who are left behind, would-be heroes or villains that don't quite make the cut. Be it some combination of uselessness, stupidity, unsightliness, or (and most commonly) a simple lack of basic standards of hygiene.~
@1414=~This group is composed of five of those individuals in addition to a gnoll that they thought would let them intimidate their way down the Sword Coast. A couple of them have some basic magical talents, but nothing extraordinary.~
@1415=~Their "leader" is an old washed up drunk by the name of Rithelm who goes out and beats up a few orcs once every few moons to scrounge up enough gold pieces to feed his habit for ale so he can continue to drink himself to death.~
@1416=~Two hundred and forty gold. I know, it's not a terribly impressive sum, but consider it a bonus in addition to whatever you take off their bodies.~
@1417=~One thing you'll learn soon in this profession is that rewards can be deceptive. Your contract rate can often be dwarfed by the spoils your marks leave behind. I call it the 'Acquired Value' of a job.~
@1418=~They were spotted fleeing east out of town not even a day ago. Ask around the bar if you need more information than that. They can't have made it far. I'm told their leader had a distinctive winged helm. Bring it back to me as proof of the deed.~
@1419=~I'll return once I have his helm then. Until then.~
@1420=~<CHARNAME>, I do hope you aren't returning empty handed. It's bad form. Again, they fled east of town. Go on and come back again once you've finished the job.~
@1421=~So <PRO_HESHE> returns. Ah, and you do have the look of someone who has engaged in the dance of death with those who were less deserving of life than you were. How do you feel, pup?~
@1422=~We have the feeling of great heroes! Many butts were kicked and evil trembled before us!~
@1423=~A waste of our time. Those pathetic curs were hardly worth the effort it took to slaughter them. Give us a challenge worthy of my blade.~
@1424=~Ah, such enthusiasm. Patience Blackguard, trust that I'll provide more... satisfying opponents soon.~
@1425=~It regrettably came to violence. They attacked me before I could try to speak to them. I did what I had to do.~
@1426=~I feel invigorated. It was a good fight and I was the victor.~
@1427=~Those fiends held the nearby temple vestibule hostage. Is nothing sacred? It was my duty and pleasure to mete justice upon them.~
@1428=~Uhh, 'pup'? You aren't going to keep calling me that, are you?~
@1429=~For now, I think I will. That's not a problem, is it?~
@1430=~I guess not.~
@1431=~Yes, in fact it is. I refuse to be demeaned by you.~
@1432=~It doesn't matter what you call me.~
@1433=~As we all do. I never imagined that peace had much of a chance with this particular bunch. Expect it in this line of work. These are not reasonable individuals.~
@1434=~We are guided by Tempus. If trial by battle is demanded, we are't proud to serve.~
@1435=~You do have the helm there, I see. No, you don't have to give it to me. I asked for proof and to see it is good enough for me. Consider it a bonus. I'll inform my contacts that the bounty is fulfilled.~
@1436=~Here is the sum I promised you. Count it all if you must, but do wait until after our business here has concluded. I'll not watch you pinch gold like a miser.~
@1437= ~Eh, hold onta yer pantaloons, wench. I won't let ya stiff us a single gold. You go on and hash out your next business. I'll be over here countin'.~
@1438=~One more thing. Their leader had a religious symbol on them. Do you recognize this?~
@1439=~Everything looks to be in order here. So what now?~
@1440=~Look at you! Quite the natural. I suspected you might enjoy the hunt. It's always nice to see such enthusiasm in this line of work.~
@1441=~Yet you do have the helm there, I see. I'll not make you give it up. I asked for proof and to see it is good enough for me. Consider it a bonus. I'll inform my contacts that the bounty is fulfilled.~
@1442=~Someone has lit quite the fire under you, have they? Well, please continue to search for such justifications to 'mete out justice' on your targets if it means you continue to perform so adequately.~
@1443=~You do have the helm there, I see. No, you don't have to give it to me. I asked for proof and to see it is good enough for me. Consider it a bonus. I'll inform my contacts that the bounty is fulfilled.~
@1444=~That's a good pup.~
@1445=~Pathetic. Will you roll over for her as well?~
@1446=~You do have the helm there, I see. No, you don't have to give it to me. I asked for proof and to see it is good enough for me. Consider it a bonus. I'll inform my contacts that the bounty is fulfilled.~
@1447=~*laughs* I don't give a whit how you feel about it. Shall we continue to deal, or is it just too much for your fragile ego to take?~
@1448=~Yes, I think I'm quite done with this. Take your bounties and stuff them up your arse.~
@1449=~*sigh* It's fine. Whatever. Lets continue doing business.~
@1450=~Now? The next hunt begins. Take a rest if you must, but a hunter's work ever continues. The Sword Coast never seems to lack for bandits and vagabonds.~
@1451=~Aye, sometimes it seems that for every bandit's heart my arrow pierces, two spring up in their place.~
@1452=~Like this next group. A band of Hobgoblins who call themselves the Redwater Raiders, identifiable by blood red sashes they wear. They've been waylaying travelers along the Coast Road and leaving few survivors. If you had qualms about exercising lethal force on that last venture, I hope you'll have no reservations this time.~
@1453=~Is there a specific client for this, or is this part of the Flaming Fist's efforts to control banditry?~
@1454=~Are there any leads for tracking them down?~
@1455=~Do you know what I can expect from them?~
@1456=~What's the pay for this one?~
@1457=~The contract was given out by an intermediary who will not divulge the true identity of his client. Of course, I've not been in this business as long as I have to not be able to connect the threads as I see them.~
@1458=~Explain it to me like a child then. Why is this such an interesting twist?~
@1459=~Are there any leads for tracking them down?~
@1460=~The Flaming Fist does not view this group of bandits as different from any other. They'll give the regular bounty rate for slaying a bandit, but have not identified them as of any specific interest.~
@1461=~So someone outside of official channels wants them dead. But if it was a noble or merchant company authoring the contract, why would they care to keep their identity so hidden? So that means there's only one other possibility.~
@1462=~Rivalry among bandits. Given the nature of the targets, I'd suspect the Chill put this one up. These Redwaters likely were hired on by the Chill but broke away to operate on their own. Obviously their former masters are not fond of the competition.~
@1463=~So we're doing jobs for bandits? I don't think I much care for that.~
@1464=~Alright, I'm ready to begin.~
@1465=~They've been hitting caravans with impressive speed and then retreating off before a response can be formed. The last attack was south of Beregost. I'm told a survivor of the raid is currently working to unload goods at the Travenhurst manor on the north side of town. I'd direct any inquiries to him.~
@1466=~A more proficient bunch than your average hobgoblins marauders. What makes them so effective is that apparently there is a pair of mages among them who enhance the group in battle. Their leader also seems to wield a very wicked-looking blade. Those who have escaped the raid said they were deeply unnerved by just the sight of it.~
@1467=~Four hundred and eighty coins. A significant improvement over your last payout, yes? Still pocket change for a reputable hunter, but I'm sure you'll find it worth the danger.~
@1468=~Good. Take the hobgoblin leader's sword as proof of the deed. It was distinctive enough, it will serve as all the evidence I need. Happy hunting.~
@1469=~Is this a social visit? I don't see the sword on you.~
@1470=~Sorry, can I get a refresher on where to start looking?~
@1471=~Nope, just passing by. Sorry for bothering you.~
@1472=~Pup, you really should get in the habit of listening closer the first time. If you need information, go question the caravan workers at the Travenhurst manor on the north side of town. One of them might have seen where the marauders escaped to.~
@1473=~Don't be ridiculous. You are killing bandits and making the Sword Coast a safer place. Why do you care who is putting up the money to do it? If it is your mission fight bandits, I'm sure you'll slaughter more than enough Chill to balance the karmic scales for helping them in this one minor instance.~
@1474=~Though I care not say so, she makes her point finely. Tis more important that we do good, even if others of evil do benefit from it.~
@1475=~Good point.~
@1476=~I suppose...~
@1477=~I am afraid that working for bandits, even tangentally, is not something I will compromise on.~
@1478=~If it comforts your asinine moral standards, the money has already been paid. You're working for me, not for the Chill. Now, was there anything else?~
@1479=~That is a symbol to the dead god Bhaal. Maybe the old man was an ex-cultist. You should get rid of it. You would not want another to find it and come to the belief you are associated with such a dark god, even dead, would you?~
@1480=~Interesting. So what now?~
@1481=~Oh now what is this crawling sensation I feel in my skin? Is that the hobgoblin captain's sword? Yes, it must be. I'd recognize a bane enchantment anywhere.~
@1482=~That is a look I think I might only get when I see a very rich and endowed man wearing pantaloons too tight and a purse too loose.~
@1483=~Yes well, we each have our proclivities don't we?~
@1484=~Recognize the handiwork?~
@1485=~It was a hard fought battle, but I prevailed.~
@1486=~The hobgoblins were of little challenge. But the sword is an adequate trophy.~
@1487=~Bane enchantments are a near and dear friend of mine. A valuable instrument in a hunter's toolbox.~
@1488=~You must have a low opinion of the living to specialize in such an anathema to it.~
@1489=~Monk, is your mind so leaden by tradition that you cannot see the virtue in practicality?~
@1490=~Not when it comes to killing, no. The tools one chooses defines us as much as what they are used for.~
@1491=~Somehow your familiarity with such enchantments is not exactly a shock to me. But regardless, the job is done.~
@1492=~Perhaps you can teach me something of the craft? I'd be very interested in that type of enchantment.~
@1493=~It was a hard fought battle, but I prevailed.~
@1494=~The hobgoblins were of little challenge. But the sword is an adequate trophy.~
@1495=~As before, keep the sword. You may find a use for it, if you can wield such an ungainly weapon. It certainly looks like it carries a rich and bloody history with it already.~
@1496=~And of course, I have not forgotten your payment. Here it is in full.~
@1497=~Give it here then. <CHARNAME>, you go ahead and continue your dealing. I've got an accounting to do.~
@1498=~So is that it?~
@1499=~Have to admit, it's been enjoyable so far. I hope you have another one lined up.~
@1500=~Why, are you looking to get out of the hunting profession already? Of course that is not it. No, another contract just came in while you were out hobgoblin hunting.~
@1501=~I am glad to hear it. The hunting life seems to suit you so far. But yes, another contract just came in while you were out hobgoblin hunting.~ 
@1502=~While you may have cleaned out the Nashkel mines of the kobolds who infested it, it seems another man named Sazazir has decided that locale would make for an excellent lair. Deep, damp holes in the ground attract a certain type of megalomaniac.~
@1503=~In this case though, I can see why Sazazir would value the arrangement. All those not-quite fresh bodies from the miners killed during the kobold occupation are a veritable army to be exploited by someone with an inclination for the darker arts.~
@1504=~Was it too much to hope that our travels would not return us to that darkened hole? I suppose even just this sliver of hope was too much to ask for.~
@1505=~The fiend! Capitalizing on one emergency to create another! And with foul magics no less.~
@1506=~I don't like the sound of this.~
@1507=~A necromancer, then. Great.~
@1508=~As if that place didn't smell bad enough before...~
@1509=~No, Necromancers always find a way to come about when they're unwanted. Likely because they are never wanted.~
@1510=~*weep* I give so much of my blood and sweat for this team, yet endure naught but disrespect *sniffle*. Oh Monty, won't you hand me a hanky!~
@1511=~Pfah! Get ye snivelin' away from me, mad wizard!~
@1512=~Not you too Monty! Fie, betrayed from all sides! Demonstrations will have to be made, oh yes.~
@1513=~So is the Nashkel township putting up this bounty?~
@1514=~I hate the thought of returning to that pit. Do we have any idea exactly how deep he set up?~
@1515=~So what do we know about this Sazazir guy?~
@1516=~What's the pay?~
@1517=~Mmph. Yes, Necromancy is so... classless.~
@1518=~*laughs* Yes, perhaps you should invest in a clip to pinch your nose shut? Necromancers will always have the advantage when they can use their stench against you.~
@1519=~They are. Though you may have a working relationship established with the mayor, you'll still be working through me on this one. They want to keep this one quiet. The fact that the depths of the mines are occupied again is being kept quiet, so don't go bumbling about talking about it. Not even the miners and guards in the upper levels have been made aware of it.~
@1520=~This mayor, Ghastkill, wants to avoid a bloodbath. And he's shrewd enough to know that sending in barely trained soldiers against a necromancer is essentially just gift wrapping them an army. So once again, it is up to a few more highly skilled individuals to save the day.~
@1521=~Highly skilled? Watch it Illasera, I might think you're starting to get fond of me.~
@1522=~That's all I need to know.~
@1523=~Continue to display a modicum of competency and I might start doing exactly that, pup. But do not mistake it, you are taking on contracts for novice hunters. I am not impressed by you. Yet.~
@1524=~I believe he is currently stalking the middle levels where operations have not yet resumed. You've been there before, you'll know the layout better than I. So far, none of the undead have advanced to the upper developed portions of the mine. It seems Sazazir is biding his time until he has a proper army. You're going to make sure he doesn't get a chance.~
@1525=~An old cultist from down south who got into trouble with Harpers and was chased up here some years ago. He's become known as a wandering kook and pariah, barred from any city or town who knows of him. Perhaps he had enough and though this as his shot to make a play at power in the region.~
@1526=~I almost feel bad for the guy.~
@1527=~Six hundred and forty gold for this one. Less than you earned for clearing out the mines the first time, but Ghastkill's purse does have to be feeling a bit pinched after constantly having his arse bailed out. Hopefully it'll be a much easier job. Sazazir hasn't had chance to establish himself yet.~
@1528=~He earned his status by trying to lure children off into the wilderness. Every mother in the region knows to warn their children away from the dirty old man in rags who walks with skeletons in the hills.~
@1529=~Right... death it is, then.~
@1530=~I see your point.~
@1531=~I am profoundly glad you don't need more convincing than that.~
@1532=~His spellbook should serve as a suitable token of your conquest. Hunt well, <CHARNAME>.~
@1533=~Checking in on me, pup? I appreciate the concern, but you do have a job to do. Come on, get to it. We can talk more after that necromancer's spellbook is in my hands.~
@1534=~I'm glad you see the practicality of such an enchantment, even when many might see it as unsavory. So strange, all weapons are meant to kill, yet just making them kill just a little more so is somehow crossing a line for some people.~
@1535=~I'm afraid the knowledge of creating one is quite the trade secret, pup. You do seem to have the gift though; you just need a little refinement. I am known to have a capricious side. Perhaps one day, I might change my mind.~
@1536=~<CHARNAME>, welcome back. How was your return to the Nashkel mines? Still as vibrant and cheerful as before?~
@1537=~Oh, just so. Next time, you should come with me. I could show you the sights and smells. Oh the smells... there's nothing else like them.~
@1538=~Very funny. The Necromancer is dead. I have his spellbook.~
@1539=~*glare*~
@1540=~As tempting an offer as that is, I think I will pass. Beside, there will be no 'next time'. If that town can't take care of itself now, they can rot.~
@1541=~I hardly try. But I am glad to see you alive, believe that at least. Find comfort that I will not be sending you that way again. If that town can't take care of itself now, they can rot.~
@1542=~Oh, don't give me that look, pup. I might break out in tears. Find comfort that I will not be sending you that way again. If that town can't take care of itself now, they can rot.~
@1543=~Now, let us see that spellbook. Hmm... let's see here. Mmm... oh my. *laughs*~	
@1544=~The man was afraid of his own skeleton bursting out of him? And of some accountant coming to kill him? Quite the pathology. Well, these all seem like mad ramblings mixed with unimpressive spellwork. Perfectly useless trash, really. Here, I'll just take this off your hands. But I'll add in a little extra for the work of bringing it here. An even thousand gold.~
@1545=~Afraid? Why would he be afraid of such a rapturous event? We should only be so lucky to witness the day our skeletons shrug off our worthless skin to live their best unlives!~
@1546=~That's an awful lot to give for 'perfectly useless trash'. What are your plans for it?~
@1547=~Sometimes powerful effects can be gleaned from even mediocre spellwork, with a little refinement.~
@1548=~Sounds fair to me. I don't much like the feeling that book gives me anyway.~
@1549=~What if I say no and I'd rather have the book?~
@1550=~Perceptive, aren't you? I have a distaste for necromancy, but I didn't get to where I was by throwing away the research of others. Perhaps there's one or two tidbits worth studying in here. I can assure you though, unless you planned to sit in a library for weeks on end, you'll likely get no more out of it.~
@1551=~Yet why dids't thou think first to lie than to tell'st thou intents? For one who demand'st such trust, thou offer little in return.~
@1552=~It wasn't a lie. I just hardly see how it matters one way or the other.~
@1553=~Indeed. Although I hardly know when I will have a chance to study it. Perhaps there's one or two tidbits worth studying in here. I can assure you though, unless you planned to sit in a library for weeks on end, you'll likely get no more out of it.~
@1554=~And you would rob us of the fruits of such research regardless? I care little and less for this arrangement.~
@1555=~Then we are agreed. Good. That concludes this necromancer business, which means that we can proceed on to the next job. This one is rather interesting.~
@1556=~I remind you that this is my operation and that a madman's scrapbook is hardly a reason to ruin such a perfectly good working relationship between us.~
@1557=~But you're going to be insistent about this, aren't you? Fine. If you let your concerns rest, I promise that I will share any magical secrets I derive from it, if it proves useful at all.~
@1558=~Tis at least an olive branch offered. The gesture, at least, is appreciated.~
@1559=~Fine. I shall voice no further objections (though one way or another, her research will be mine).~
@1560=~I suppose that seems fair. Fine, take it then.~
@1561=~No, I don't think I will. I'm walking away from this arrangement. I just don't trust you.~
@1562=~You are familiar with the edict of Candlekeep that in order to be admitted, you must present a tome of sufficient value to be added to the library there? It seems that an Oni, which you might know better as an 'Ogre-Mage', has taken to waylaying travelers and taking their contributions before they can arrive at the gates.~
@1563=~That will be your next target. The client wants the book that was taken from her as well as the Oni to be removed from the area.~
@1564=~I suppose it's too much trouble for Candlekeep to send out the Watchers to chase him away?~
@1565=~So he just took the book from your client? She still lives?~
@1566=~Any details to be had about the ogre?~
@1567=~I'm familiar with that road. Where along it is he?~
@1568=~What does this one pay out?~
@1569=~You should know that Candlekeep refuses to interfere in any matters outside their walls.~
@1570=~C'mon <CHARNAME>, you know they'll leave a dying man ta thirst rather than give him their waterskins unless he can provide 'em a tome first. Miserly old bugbears...~
@1571=~So he just took the book from your client? She still lives?~
@1572=~Alright, I'm prepared to take care of this.~
@1573=~I don't believe he's physically attacked any of the travelers he has stolen from. He simply stops them and demands their tome. None have dared refuse.~
@1574=~Most uncommon for an Ogre to only steal from travelers but leave them unharmed. They are usually vile things, compelled to kill.~
@1575=~Perhaps he can be talked to then if he has been nonviolent up to this point.~
@1576=~That would be atypical. Oni are far more capable than the brutish oafs they're falsely thought to be cousins of, but that does not change the fact that they have little but enmity towards others not of their kind. The preferable outcome would be for his body to be cold in the ground and the book in your hand. Death solves more problems long term, trust me.~
@1577=~Just the same, I'd rather try. You said the client specifically wanted the ogre removed, not killed?~
@1578=~*sigh* Yes, the contract specifies removal and not death, though I think the spirit of the contract is fairly implicit, if not the letter. If you want to have tea with an oni and try to win him over with rhetoric, be my guest. Just make sure someone in your group survives to report back to me so I can have a laugh about hearing how it all went wrong.~
@1579=~A few. He calls himself 'The Gentleman', if you can believe it. Perhaps he has adopted an air of civility to better deal with his victims. Or it could all just be mockery. Oni are not unclever. I can't say what or why he's doing this, besides perhaps as an easy way to try and obtain some magical tomes. If there's one thing you can always depend on, it's that an ogre mage's motivation is growing their own power and knowledge.~
@1580=~North of the road just by the ocean. I'm told there's a field of stones arranged into four circles. Possibly some pagan ritual site. If there is some latent magical properties or convergence of leylines, it would make sense for him to be drawn there.~
@1581=~That's where Gorion...~
@1582=~An even eight hundred for this job. The client really wants that book back.~
@1583=~The tome you are looking for contains the original manuscripts of the plays of the bard Salena Fairsky. A notably competent playwright although her wordplay can be a bit meandering. Bring it back to me for your reward. I'll have to take your word on the fate of the oni. But remember that to a Hunter, your word is everything.~
@1584=~Come now pup, you know how I feel about social visits. We've a professional relationship, so I'd rather not see you until you've dealt with that oni and brought back this book.~
@1585=~Is something wrong?~
@1586=~Oh jeez. Are you gonna be ok, <CHARNAME>? Lemme know if ya need anything. I'll be right beside ya, ya know that.~
@1587=~Sorry. It's nothing important.~
@1588=~My mentor. He was killed in that very spot recently.~
@1589=~I see. Then consider it forgotten.~
@1590=~My condolences. But do not let it intrude on your mission. I doubt the ogre's location is any more than coincidence.~
@1591=~Greetings again my young hunter of men and monster. Do you have news of the oni and his books?~
@1592=~I do. I was able to reason with the Gentleman and get him to leave the region. I've also retrieved the book our client asked for.~
@1593=~Yes. I've slain the ogre-mage and retrieved the book he stole from him.~
@1594=~You were? I see. That was not something I expected. I do not know if the client will be thrilled to hear it, but perhaps I will just leave that detail out. Killing him would have been simpler. Ah, but it hardly matters.~
@1595=~Not all conflicts must be resolved with violence. I was glad that you were able to find an equitable outcome, <CHARNAME>.~
@1596=~I am also not sure I agree with letting him go free after the crimes he committed. But perhaps it was better to demonstrate mercy in this case.~
@1597=~You should give peace a chance once in a while Illasera. You might be surprised how well it works.~
@1598=~Excellent. I never doubted for a moment that you would resolve this matter efficiently. The client will be pleased.~ 
@1599=~One less villain plaguing the Sword Coast. He may have spoken with civility, but his nature was the same as any fiend.~
@1600=~He maintained the facade of an erudite scholar well, but no ogre's magical prowess can exceed that of Edwin Odesseiron (As these fools will one day learn first hand.)~
@1601=~I've enjoyed testing myself against the targets you've given so far.~
@1602=~I'm just hoping that your bounties actually make me break a sweat some day. This has been child's play so far.~
@1603=~Yes well, let me just take that book off your hand and give to you the reward you were promised.~
@1604=~Then that brings us to your next contract. Your return was timely on this one, as it just came to me before you arrived.~
@1605=~A wealthy collector from Baldur's Gate hired an archeology team along with a group of mercenaries as protection to scour a tomb in the nearby hillside. The collector believed it may have been of one of Alaundo's own disciples in his time and he wished any relics that could be found within for his collection.~
@1606=~Truly? A disciple of Alaundo? Imagine the lore and stories that could be found in that tomb! Maybe even some dirty limericks...~
@1607=~A tomb like that, yet unplundered? Sounds too good to be true.~
@1608=~The archeology team reported finding a looking glass that could have been a mirror of true seeing. Quite the find and our collector was happy to receive it. He sent a mediator down south with a few guards to meet the expeditionary team at the crossroads between the Friendly Arm and Beregost to retrieve the artifact and pay the team.~
@1609=~It is safe to assume that the hand off did not go according to plan.~
@1610=~Well, the expeditionary team met the caravan. But when the mirror was requested, the mercenaries butchered them. Rather violently, according to the accounts of the survivors. So now he needs a group of able adventurers to track down these mercenaries and retrieve his prize.~
@1611=~Tell me more about the client. Who is this collector?~
@1612=~Did the archeology team come to the rendezvous as well?~
@1613=~What do we know about these mercenaries? They have a history of reneging on their deals?~
@1614=~We can't assume they've stayed in the area. Smart move would have been to take the mirror and head south to Amn.~
@1615=~What's the pay on this one?~
@1616=~Sir Inbred von Flatulence of Who-Gives-A-Rat's-Arse. These noble collector types are all the same, in my experience. Stuffed shirts with no actual appreciation for the objects they crave or the power that might be in them, instead content to just display them to elevate their status among their backstabbing friends.~
@1617=~Heh yeah, we got plenty of those types around Candlekeep. Puttin' grease on the back of their chairs or sneakin a frog in their linens was always good for a laugh though.~
@1618=~They are good for one thing though. They pay quite well. That's all that matters for this contract.~
@1619=~That's enough. I am ready to get started.~
@1620=~I believe only one of them did, an apprentice who was to present the object to the collector in person. The rest of the team stayed behind to finish the excavation.~
@1621=~The Happy Companions out of Luskan. Their reputation is muddy. They usually get the job done, just with a few more casualties than was necessary. They've botched a few jobs just for being excessively cruel. It wouldn't shock me if they reneged on the deal. But this sounds extreme even for them.~
@1622=~Coulda been they just didn't like the look of 'em. I've killed fer less.~
@1623=~I am never surprised that the rivvin would eat each other for scraps. But we should beware this relic they found. Such things may push toward savagery with dark compulsion.~
@1624=~Hm, a band I am familiar with and even almost considered joining before I learned what witless braggarts they were. It would be a pleasure to disembowel them.~
@1625=~As for the group themself, a competent mercenary band with both divine and arcane might on their side. Be especially wary of the leader, Adogeon Sharpgrin. He puts on the air of a fool but was an assassin before he joined the group. If you encounter the group and do not see him, it is likely because he is about to sink a blade into your back.~ 
@1626=~That would be the smart move, yes. But this morning I heard a caravan rush into town, saying that they had seen a group of madmen screaming up at the sun as it rose from the horizon. Some of the descriptions did curiously match our Happy Companions. It seems they've abandoned sanity in more ways than one.~
@1627=~More proof then that something happened in the tomb that ensnared them by a darker power. Unless this is some absurd surfacer ritual I have yet to learn of.~
@1628=~It does sound like they've been afflicted by -something-, that is certain. It would be prudent to bring along some measure of divine magic with you, just in case.~
@1629=~Nine hundred and sixty gold. I am sure that will be worth a short trip up the road? I will not lie to you, this particular mercenary group will make you work for your earnings, if you are able to catch and attempt to dispose them.~
@1630=~I am glad to hear it. Go north, dispose of this band of madmen, and retrieve the relic. Good hunting, <CHARNAME>.~
@1631=~It is always a pleasure to see you. But I would not want social visits to interfere with your hunting. Go on, time is wasting.~
@1632=~Welcome back to civilization, <CHARNAME>. Have you found the Happy Companions and handled them appropriately?~
@1633=~The Happy Companions are no more and I retrieved the mirror that they had stolen. Go ahead and take it.~
@1634=~I did. But the mirror you sent me to retrieve is likely what drove them to madness. I would take care with handling it, but here you are.~
@1635=~I thought the job was to recover the mirror. Aren't you more interested in that than what their fate is?~
@1636=~Welcome back to civilization, <CHARNAME>. Have you found the Happy Companions and handled them appropriately?~
@1637=~I did. Though the mirror you sent me to retrieve was broken when I found it. I was only able to recover its remains.~
@1638=~I did. But the mirror you sent me to retrieve is likely what drove them to madness. It was broken when I tried to exorcise the demon from the archeologist it had possessed.~
@1639=~I thought the job was to recover the mirror. Aren't you more interested in that than what their fate is?~
@1640=~Ah, a most welcome outcome. I do so enjoy hearing of a job going well. Come, let me see this mirror then.~
@1641=~...~
@1642=~<CHARNAME>, are you a complete moron? You *do* realize that this is quite cursed, don't you?~
@1643=~It's what? Uhh...~
@1644=~You wanted the mirror. I gave it to you. I didn't think you needed me to safety check it for you first.~
@1645=~Don't be paranoid. I didn't think it was all that dangerous, at least in the short term.~
@1646=~I see. That's interesting, but not unexpected. So long as they are dead though, and you have the mirror. Let me see it, then. I can suppress the cursed aura of it and dispose of it properly.~
@1647=~Dispose of it, or unlock its secrets for your own?~
@1648=~Not all of us are so hungry for power that we'd tempt fate by dealing in cursed objects, Blackguard.~
@1649=~Hmm yes, it's best that this be destroyed. I doubt the collector will feel overly distraught for not receiving it. You are owned full payment, regardless of the state of the mirror.~
@1650=~I am. But their fates are tied to that mirror. I can only assume that if you disposed of them, the mirror would follow naturally.~
@1651=~Alright, well the Happy Companions are no more and I retrieved the mirror that they had stolen. Go ahead and take it.~
@1652=~They were disposed of. But the mirror you sent me to retrieve is likely what drove them to madness. I would take care with handling it, but here you are.~
@1653=~Broken when you found it? Are you certain this isn't just a cover for clumsy fingers? Ah, but allow me to see the remnants.~
@1654=~Well, I can hardly fault you for this. The object was quite cursed, that much is clear. I can feel an abyssal residue cling to even just the frame.~
@1655=~Yes, well I guess this means the objective is not fully complete this time.~
@1656=~You're not disappointed? I have to admit, I'm a bit surprised you don't have a snide comment for me now.~
@1657=~A demon? Exorcism? You're not saving face after clumsily dropping it on the way here, are you? Let me see that, hmm?~
@1658=~I am. But their fates are tied to that mirror. I can only assume that if you disposed of them, the mirror would follow naturally.~
@1659=~Cursed, you absolute moron. Just carrying this could have driven you mad and...~
@1660=~Mpmh. Forgive my harsh words there. Don't you worry about it, pup. I'll just take this off your hands.~
@1661=~This will need to be properly disposed of. I doubt the collector will feel overly distraught for not receiving it. You are owned full payment, regardless of the state of the mirror.~
@1662=~Tsch. Aren't you a mouthy little pup today? Fine, I'll have to choose to believe that you just trusted my magical acumen enough that you thought it not worth mentioning.~
@1663=~And yet, I think I will make good on the offer I made to you for this. Nine hundred and sixty gold. Take it. You deserve it, regardless of the outcome.~
@1664=~Oh, <CHARNAME>. I know I may be harsh, but do you believe me unreasonable? This outcome would have been no different than if I had done the job myself.~
@1665=~I must say, you have done quite well for me in total. So well that I must regret to tell you that this was the last contract I have for you now. I have obligations further north, and it is about time that I made my way.~
@1666=~Tis a shame. Tempus favors us for seeking out these battles. Ah, but there will always be others!~
@1667=~Thank the gods for that. These small riches were entirely too much effort. Now someone, please direct me to the closest bath and most handsome eunuch to rub out these calluses on my feet.~
@1668=~Just when it was starting to get fun. I could get used to this whole 'contract killing' business.~
@1669=~But, before I leave, I wonder if you would be interested in sharing a drink with me. You have time away from saving the Sword Coast to indulge me an evening, don't you?~
@1670=~You want to have a drink with me? That's a bit surprising.~
@1671=~Of course. I would be honored to share a drink with you, Illasera.~
@1672=~I'll have to turn you down. I really would rather keep things between us strictly professional.~
@1673=~I'd sooner share a drink with a flatulent gibberling.~
@1674=~You're... refusing me? I'm hurt, <CHARNAME>. Oh, not truly so. Professional acquaintances we will remain. Perhaps we will meet again, <CHARNAME>. Until then? Do me a favor and don't die.~ 
@1675=~Do I truly offend you so? Well then, all cards are on the table at least. Perhaps we will meet again, if you can stand to see me. Until then? Do me a favor and don't die.~
@1676=~Why? Do I still give you the impression that I am not fond of you? Oh, <CHARNAME>, nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, I am interested in sitting down and perhaps learning more about you. I might even share something of myself, if you would care to listen.~
@1677=~That actually sounds nice. Ok, I'm in.~
@1678=~Sure thing. But you're buying.~
@1679=~If it's all the same to you, I'd rather keep things professional between us. I must turn your offer down.~
@1680=~I'm glad to hear it. Come, let us take a table a bit away from the crowd.~

// Illasera bar scene 1

@1681=~Yes, Elma. What about you, <CHARNAME>?~
@1682=~A crisp red wine would suit me tonight.~
@1683=~I'm feeling bold. I'll have a dark wine.~
@1684=~Evermead. I accept no less.~
@1685=~I would prefer some tea, if you have it.~
@1686=~Uh, do you just have any ale here?~
@1687=~Just water for me.~
@1688=~A good choice. Elma, a glass of ruby as well as the Berduskan.~
@1689=~Of like minds we are then. Isn't that interesting? Elma, bring us two glasses of the Berduskan.~
@1690=~A <PRO_MANWOMAN> of expensive tastes, aren't we? You know, the cost of one glass of Evermead is worth more than some novice hunters make on a whole bounty. The farmers around here wouldn't be able to afford a thimble full of it after a year's worth of labor.~
@1691=~I'll hardly let myself be upstaged like that. Elma, cancel my usual. Bring me two Evermeads. This is a special occasion.~
@1692=~The tea here is passable at best, but if that is what you wish. Elma, bring some leaf tea as well as my usual Berduskan.~
@1693=~Tsch. Ale. It is not quite the establishment for more common beverages. Elma, I seem to recall that there was a keg in the basement? For 'emergencies' in case that greedy dwarf from the nearby shop came in. A flagon of that along with my usual Berduskan.~
@1694=~Only water? Tsch. Afraid that things will get a bit too exciting here with me? Oh no no, it's fine. Sobriety is actually a respectable quality in a hunter, if a boring one. Elma, a cup of water with my usual Berduskan.~
@1695=~So, <CHARNAME>. Savior of Nashkel, bandit slayer, hunter of men and beast. Where oh where will we start?~
@1696=~The most obvious place, I think. You come out of nowhere and suddenly make a big splash in the region. But who are you, really?~
@1697=~Who am I? That’s a rather big question, isn’t it?~
@1698=~You seem like someone who thinks she has everyone figured out. Why ask me that?~
@1699=~Who am I? Woah woah, why don’t you go first?~
@1700=~A student of magic and lore. I follow my foster father’s footsteps in the practice of the arcane to one day become a great mage.~
@1701=~Surrounded by books, I took interest in the art of war. I studied tactics and formations while training in combat with the Watchers.~
@1702=~I am a <PRO_MANWOMAN> of faith. I put my trust in the divine that I have been set on the right path and have been gifted with some measure of their power.~
@1703=~I am something of a wealth relocation agent. Someone with boundless curiosity for what’s hidden behind locks and inside pockets. It’s gotten me into some trouble, but I’m always able to find my way out of it.~ 
@1704=~I’ve always had a great appreciation for stories and ballads. There’s power in the old tales, and somehow it’s always just come to me when I’ve sung them.~
@1705=~A defender of good and champion of justice. I tutored under an old retired paladin who showed me how to channel my faith through my sword. I travel hoping to make the world a better place.~
@1706=~Interestingly enough, I am a pupil of nature itself. I hear its commands in each gust of wind, in every twitter of birds. I will do all I can to protect it from those who would abuse its charity.~
@1707=~Something of a woods<PRO_MANWOMAN>. I’ve always felt more at home outside; sleeping under the stars rather than under roofs. I've learned to fight so I can protect my home and guide travelers.~
@1708=~A student of the arts of combat from far away Kara Tura. I train my body to be as effective a weapon as any iron implement, while also mastering my own will.~
@1709=~I heard strange voices calling to me one night and learned of a whole world of spirits just beyond sight. I’m a vessel for them and they speak through me their will.~
@1710=~Someone who feels like <PRO_HESHE> hasn’t even been allowed a breath of air since I left home. I’m always on the run, yet it appears I keep getting chased into some plot or another.~
@1711=~I’ve always aspired to greatness. As soon as I found myself out in the open world, I decided on a course that I thought would most change the world, and I will continue to do so to find my fame and fortunes.~
@1712=~Just a <PRO_MANWOMAN> trying to make my way in the world. If I’ve achieved anything noteworthy, it’s by pure whims of fate.~
@1713=~I’m honestly not sure myself.~
@1714=~Not too big for you I hope. Small talk bores me. Has anyone honestly ever cared what another has thought of the weather? Humor me.~
@1715=~I think I have a good idea who you are, yes. But I would like to hear your perspective. What people think of themselves can be enlightening when they aren't more boring than drying paint. I am not an incurious woman.~
@1716=~Because I asked first, of course. Come now, there will be time for me to regale you with my life’s story, but you must go first.~
@1717=~The arcane is a wonderful tool for those with wit enough to use it. Though its applications are as numerous as the drops in a rainstorm. What drew you to the arcane, may I ask?~ 
@1718=~Power. With these talents, reality itself bends to my will. What other reason does one need?~
@1719=~Knowledge. There is so much hidden lore out there that begs to be uncovered. I want to know all I can.~
@1720=~Inspiration. Magic is an expression of something inside of me, like art or music.~
@1721=~It just seemed like the thing to do. With my foster father tutoring me, magic came easily to me. I haven’t really thought about it much more than that.~
@1722=~Yet you had never set foot on a battlefield before all this, had you? I wonder just how good all that theory and play against friendly mentors was when you first had to fight for your life.~
@1723=~It’s true, all the studying and practice in the world could never substitute for real experience. After I left my home, I threw out everything I learned there to study true battle against foes who wanted me dead.~
@1724=~I found that my studies prepared me quite well, actually. Combat can often be reduced to its fundamental mechanics, and there are laws and theories that dictate its flow. Mastery of that theory is as important as battle instincts.~
@1725=~It was an adjustment, certainly. You find that some things you studied don’t quite work while other things you could have never thought of beforehand become crucial. So it helped, but even still I’ve had to relearn or even unlearn some things.~
@1726=~I will not lie and pretend that I’ve ever felt that the gods have been a friend of mine. I have spent most of my life speaking naught but curses to their names. Oh, don’t give me that look, I won’t speak an ill word of them in your presence. But tell me truly, do you really feel blessed by the gods, given the life that you lead?~
@1727=~Of course. They’ve always come to me in the times of my greatest need and shown me the way. I would be lost without them.~
@1728=~My life hasn’t always been pristine, especially lately. But these are just trials I must endure. Faith asks us to find purpose in suffering, and we become better for it.~
@1729=~Well... lately, I’ve had second thoughts. My relationship with the divine is a bit on the rocks. But I am still granted powers for my prayers, so that has to mean something.~
@1730=~No, I spit on all of the gods except for my own. But through my actions, I will draw strength to destroy all these other infidels and heretics.~
@1731=~The hero of Nashkel, some common rogue? *chuckles* And now you hunt bandits and other miscreants. Are you really so much better than the criminals you have now taken up against?~
@1732=~Of course I’m better. I don’t get caught, for one thing. These bandits are just so lacking in finesse, it’s embarrassing.~
@1733=~Hey, I may be a scoundrel, but I’ve never knowingly taken a copper from anyone who couldn’t afford it or didn't deserve it. I’m much more of the ‘steal from the rich, give to the poor’ type of rogue.~
@1734=~No, but don’t tell the Flaming Fist that. Working for them has been great cover to rob this whole region blind.~
@1735=~Oh, an -artist- then. I should count myself lucky then that you did not bring a lute to the table. I’ll never understand bards. Oh, I appreciate music just fine, but the theatricality of it all is lost on me. Dare I ask what inspired you?~
@1736=~The stories that the Keepers collected. Those old legends ignited a spark in me that made me want to both share them as well as create a few of my own.~
@1737=~A wandering singer came to my home once and regaled us through a long rainy night with songs. I knew then that I wanted to move others the same way that singer moved me.~
@1738=~I saw a play performed once when I was young from a group of traveling actors. It felt more real than the life I had known up to that point. I longed for more.~
@1739=~Have you ever just listened to the world around you and felt a music in it? It might sound silly, but I’ve always just heard this underlying rhythm all around me my whole life. My talents are just an expression of what I hear.~
@1740=~Oh of course. An exemplar of goodness, righteousness, civility, and punctuality. But what even is ‘justice’? Every paladin I’ve ever encountered has used it as a shorthand for a reason to smite those they don’t care for with their shiny sticks.~
@1741=~Justice is ensuring that the innocent are protected and the guilty are punished. There is an order to the world, an order that would benefit all goodly people, and I assist in making sure that it functions properly.~
@1742=~I can’t speak for all paladins, but violence should always be a last resort. I believe that there is a goodness in all people, that the 'evil' are just misguided. Compassion is a better balm for the soul than retribution.~
@1743=~The gods of good and righteousness show us the way. If your only experience with paladins has been violence, then that says more for you than it does for them.~
@1744=~Why should I explain myself to someone who has such obvious disdain for what I do? You will never understand.~
@1745=~Don’t your kind shun civilization of any kind? Yet here you are, within an inn made of stone mined from the ground and wood hewn from trees, among farming people who think themselves masters of the crops they grow.~
@1746=~I would rather mentor the people here to live in more harmony with the land than chide them for the comforts of civilization. I believe that with proper teaching, they will better embrace nature.~
@1747=~Civilization and nature are not such opposing forces. Many druids, myself included, have taken up the thought that civilization is just another expression of nature. We just make sure that it does not overgrow like choking weeds. Then, a pruning might be needed.~
@1748=~It’s true, I despise this place. But it is a necessary evil. I cannot achieve my goals without making forays into cities and towns that would be better given back to the land.~
@1749=~I've always found that your type make exceptional hunters when it comes to beasts and monsters. It's always more difficult when it comes to the matter of hunting people though. Do you also draw such a line between monsters and men?~
@1750=~Men and monster are not the same as you say. Every man is born with the potential for good, even if life eventually twists them on the wrong path. The same cannot be said for monsters.~
@1751=~Good or evil, the dividing line comes down to power. Men are weak and preyed upon and so I do so in turn to those who would prey on them. If a group of peaceful orcs were attacked on their lands by humans, I might be inclined to protect the orcs.~
@1752=~There is some truth to what you say. Men can behave rather monstrously. I make that decision in the moment, when my conscience demands.~
@1753=~A strange affliction. I've heard of some mountain hermits claiming the spirits speak to them, but always just assumed they were kooks and charlatans. So you just, obey what the voices in your head tell you to?~
@1754=~Not always. It's like a conversation, or debate. There are good spirits and there are bad spirits. Then there are other spirits beyond any conception of morality. I mediate and compromise between them.~
@1755=~Without question. The spirits have great wisdom. Only they can see both the world and what lies beyond. It would be foolish of me to not heed them.~
@1756=~They are more than just voices in the head. The spirits call to me when I ask them to. I do follow their guidance, but I am not without freedom in the arrangement.~
@1757=~Almost like some kind of guiding force or destiny far beyond you is chasing you into it. Do you believe in fate, <CHARNAME>?~
@1758=~Yes, I think I do.~
@1759=~No. There is no fate but what we make.~
@1760=~I don't know. It doesn't matter either way.~
@1761=~So you are defined by not what you do, but by your ambitions? How then do you want to be known among the Sword Coast?~
@1762=~Someone who is here to help. Someone who won't back down from a fight and will champion the little guy wherever I can.~
@1763=~I want to be feared and respected. I want those who look on me to wet their small clothes knowing that their lives could be extinguished at my whim.~
@1764=~That I upended status quo and brought a little excitement into their lives, wherever I went.~
@1765=~A beacon of peace and stability. Where I go, I hope people can follow my model and live better, prosperous lives.~
@1766=~I don't care how people remember me. Good or bad, people tend to reframe history to their liking. So I'll just strive to be remembered and let the historians dictate how.~
@1767=~And you'd just surrender yourself to fate so? You are a passenger in the backseat of the carriage that is your own life?~
@1768=~More or less. Honestly, I just don't concern myself with it much.~
@1769=~Well, a backseat driver maybe. Lets just say I guide with a light touch.~
@1770=~It doesn't matter. Either I'm in control of my fate, or I'm not. Fighting it won't change a thing.~
@1771=~You don't know? Has your time adventuring taught you nothing about who you are? All of the trials and suffering so far? Ridiculous.~
@1772=~I don't know what to tell you. It's an ongoing process.~
@1773=~Honestly, I'm just not a very introspective person.~
@1774=~Much as I expected. That is not a bad thing, of course. People like you and I are drawn to power and shaping the Realms. It's in our blood.~
@1775=~Knowledge is an admirable aspiration, but only when it's for an end. You should find a way to better turn your curiosity to your advantage.~
@1776=~Much as I expected. You have a natural talent. From the moment I saw you, I could see a potential to shape that talent into something special.~
@1777=~I admit, I find your incuriosity... well, curious is the kindest way I can say it. How much more could you achieve if you gave the world around you more thought?~
@1778=~Adaptability is commendable. There is a saying among hunters. One who does not learn to swim, sinks. You were tossed in the middle of a fathomless ocean.~
@1779=~Mmph. I've never trusted any being with more power than myself. You would do well to question those who pull your strings. They may not be so benign as you believe.~
@1780=~At least you're asking questions. I've never had much respect for those who follow blindly.~
@1781=~You follow a code then? I suppose we all must have one. Though I prefer the flexibility to decide what's right in the moment.~
@1782=~If I was not trying my best to ensure this conversation remains pleasant, I would say that is hopelessly naive. So instead, let us say that your perspective is... curious. And not what I would expect.~
@1783=~Come now, I thought I was at least trying to be polite. You won't begrudge me for finding your ways strange and a bit backwards, I hope?~
@1784=~Quite the philsopher. There is wisdom, of a sort, in your words. Personally, I've always preferred to act rather than just think how to act.~
@1785=~Then I should count myself so lucky to enjoy your company in a place you so abhor.~
@1786=~That sounds tiresome. I don't think I could ever have the patience for such a thing.~
@1787=~Tsch. I've always had a distaste for the thought myself. Powerful beings may try to move us around like pieces on a board, but I'll spit in their eye and move in ways contrary to their designs at every step.~
@1788=~I don't know whether I should pity or envy you for just stumbling through life with no other goal than your own amusement. At the very least, watching at a distance might result in a few laughs.~
@1789=~Well, it's an honest answer, if nothing else. I would hope you find yourself soon at least. For your sake.~
@1790=~Regardless, it's interesting. And now you are here, fled from Candlekeep and having lost Gorion, hounded by assassins at your heels.~
@1791=~Oh, are you surprised I know exactly who you are and where you came from? Hold your answer, it seems our drinks are here.~
@1792=~No. That will be all. Leave us. Thank you, Elma.~
@1793=~I hope it is to your liking. So then, where were we?~
@1794=~Ingratiating yourself with the locals, Illasera? That girl seems petrified of you.~
@1795=~The server seems nice, if a little bit skittish.~
@1796=~You were about to tell me how you know all that about me.~
@1797=~I guess it's not surprising that you know where I come from.~
@1798=~Hm? Ah, yes. A few nights ago when leaving the inn on business, I caught a man assaulting her out beyond the city gates. I put an arrow through his throat. I believe it startled the silly girl.~
@1799=~You protected her? Trying out at being a hero, are you?~
@1800=~A bit extreme. Seems you could have stopped him without killing the man.~
@1801=~She should be on her knees then thanking you.~
@1802=~You'd think she'd at least have a little more gratitude.~
@1803=~Tsch. Nothing of the sort. It was simply a way to ward away the boredom for a moment. I might not have done it if I knew how she would quiver around me now.~
@1804=~I think you're lying. You have some honor in you, buried deep away.~
@1805=~Fair enough. Easier to get away with murder when you have such a justifiable reason.~
@1806=~That would require more effort than I care to give. Besides, I hadn't practiced my archery that day.~
@1807=~I think you're lying. You have some honor in you, buried deep away.~
@1808=~Fair enough. Easier to get away with murder when you have such a justifiable reason.~
@1809=~Euch. No, I'd rather not. I've no interest in fawning from stupid peasant girls. Maybe in the past I might have entertained the thought of taking advantage of such gratitutde, but after you've had a few peasants, you've had them all. They're like unflavored porridge.~
@1810=~I didn't mean it like that. It would be gross to try and bed someone whose life you saved.~
@1811=~She's pretty enough porridge though. I wouldn't say no.~
@1812=~That's a rather cynical view. The smallfolk can be more interesting than you give them credit for.~
@1813=~Oh dear, you've seen right past me, pup. It's true, I'm actually quite the saint. I donate all of my earnings to the local temples and help build houses for beggers whenever I can. Truly, you're such a keen judge of character.~
@1814=~You were about to tell me how you know all that about me.~
@1815=~I guess it's not surprising that you know where I come from.~
@1816=~Good, you understand. I wouldn't want to seem like I am going soft on you.~
@1817=~You were about to tell me how you know all that about me.~
@1818=~I guess it's not surprising that you know where I come from.~
@1819=~Hmph. Is it? Those ridiculous stories about paupers saving princesses and becoming married and happily ever after are half the reason most adventurers take up the mantle. Perhaps you just don't like romances boiled down to their essential transactional parts.~
@1820=~Hey, I like those stories! They aren't like that.~
@1821=~There's that predictable Illasera cynicism shining through once again. Those tales aren't all that bad. Some of them can be sweet.~
@1822=~I agree. Those tales are all a bunch of ignorant rot, borne of a lusty bard's idle fantasies.~
@1823=~Porridge is porridge. But don't let me stop you if you want to have a go at her. Maybe you'll have more enjoyment of her inept fumblings.~
@1824=~Maybe I will. But you were about to tell me how you know all that about me.~
@1825=~Possibly. But anyways, I guess it's not surprising that you know where I come from.~
@1826=~Do you really care so much of what I think of others? There has to be a more interesting topic of discussion.~
@1827=~You were about to tell me how you know all that about me.~
@1828=~I guess it's not surprising that you know where I come from.~
@1829=~*laughs* Oh pup, read between the lines sometimes. Ah, but there's no accounting for taste I suppose. What else was there for us to talk about?~
@1830=~You were about to tell me how you know all that about me.~
@1831=~I guess it's not surprising that you know where I come from.~
@1832=~I'll admit that some of them have pleasant compositions. But the implicit meaning behind them always rings false to me. Ah, but like what you like, I'll not stomp on your parade.~
@1833=~You were about to tell me how you know all that about me.~
@1834=~I guess it's not surprising that you know where I come from.~
@1835=~Indeed. But I would prefer our topic changes to something that isn't art criticism.~
@1836=~You were about to tell me how you know all that about me.~
@1837=~I guess it's not surprising that you know where I come from.~
@1838=~*sips* Is it truly such a surprise? The bounty was issued to every low life, assassin, and illicit hunter in the region, likely before the morning after your escape had even dawned. Of course it was floated by me as well. When you came into this bar, I recognized you. The description on the contract leaves little confusion.~
@1839=~And yet, you did not take on the bounty. Why?~
@1840=~I suppose I should thank you for not trying to collect on it.~
@1841=~*chuckles* Pup, the original bounty was for two-hundred gold. Imagine, Illasera the Quick, getting out of bed for such a paltry sum.~
@1842=~Although, the contract has matured considerably since that initial offer. I wonder how much your head is worth now, hm?~
@1843=~Very funny.~
@1844=~You wouldn't dare...~
@1845=~*chuckles* Ah, but I do amuse myself. But no, you musn't worry your pretty little head over it. I've no interest in collecting your bounty. They could hardly afford me and besides, I have my own mission here.~
@1846=~Pretty, huh?~
@1847=~Still going to keep that 'mission' of yours vague, huh?~
@1848=~You have my thanks, regardless. So what else is there to talk about?~
@1849=~Oh, <CHARNAME>, you musn't worry your pretty little head over it. I've no interest in collecting your bounty. They could hardly afford me and besides, I have my own purpose here.~
@1850=~Tsch. Don't pretend you aren't aware of your own attractiveness. You must have realized by now how you draw the eyes of others.~
@1851=~And have I drawn your eyes as well? We could take the rest of this little dialogue to a bedroom...~
@1852=~Alright alright, laying off. So what else is there to talk about?~
@1853=~Just a term of endearment, pup. Don't make anything of it.~
@1854=~Ouch. So, what else then?~
@1855=~I am. Don't confuse this friendly exchange as an invitation to pry into my affairs. I take them very seriously.~
@1856=~Noted. So, what else then?~
@1857=~I... no. No I cannot. Do not take this as meaning I do not think you're attractive or sexually alluring.~
@1858=~There's just something... ah, damn it all, I can't explain. Perhaps it's best to say I'm just not looking for a lay right now.~
@1859=~A shame. So, what else then?~
@1860=~Hmm... how about this foster father of yours. Gorion. He was such a notable mage that even I had heard mention of him. What was your relationship with him like?~
@1861=~As close as any father by blood could be. He raised, educated, and inspired me. I still grieve for his loss each day. I intend to honor his legacy.~
@1862=~We had a rocky relationship and rarely saw eye to eye. We fought more often than not. Still, I did love the old man.~
@1863=~Distant. We always had this gulf between us and I suspect neither of us quite knew how to cross it. Still, I think there was love there.~
@1864=~I always felt he was somewhat resentful of me. I kept my distance and stayed out of trouble the best I could. Seeing what he risked for me, I wonder now if I was wrong. It wouldn't change things either way.~
@1865=~He always limited me, told me of all the things I couldn't or shouldn't do. I'm glad to be out from under his shadow.~
@1866=~Pfah, he was a foolish old man who always thought he knew best. The joke's on him, now that his body is cold in the dirt.~
@1867=~I don't want to talk about that.~
@1868=~I see. It's still very recent, so I suppose you must still be grieving. I am sorry for your loss, for what that is worth.~
@1869=~Thank you. Did you have anyone like that?~
@1870=~It's worth some amount, at least.~
@1871=~Is that compassion I hear from you Illasera?~
@1872=~Then losing him was at least an opportunity for you. However you felt about him, it seems you were able to use the upbringing he gave you to your advantage.~
@1873=~That much is true. How about you? Any tiresome mentors?~
@1874=~You give him too much credit still. But yes, I have grown stronger from his passing.~
@1875=~Too personal? Fine, I'll not needle you further about him.~
@1876=~Thank you. What about you? Have any important mentor figures in your life?~
@1877=~Good. It's just not a topic I want discussed.~
@1878=~I... suppose so. Not quite like yours, exactly. Sir Cormysh. He was a retired knight I was 'adopted by' as a child after being expelled from the orphanage.~
@1879=~So your parents...?~
@1880=~Tell me about him.~
@1881=~I bet he was a real bastard, huh?~
@1882=~Expelled? So you were a bit of a hellion as a child?~
@1883=~Mmm yes, well, you could say I had a mentor-figure myself, growing up. Not quite like Gorion, to be sure. Sir Cormysh. He was a retired knight I was 'adopted by' as a child after being expelled from the orphanage.~
@1884=~Remember it dearly; it may be the last time you hear anything of the sort from these lips again.~
@1885=~My mother was quite insane and my father is... well, let us just say that he was not available. I was sent to an orphanage early in life. It seems our kind don't get to have the luxury of loving families.~
@1886=~Our kind?~
@1887=~I'm sorry to hear that. So tell me about him.~
@1888=~I bet he was a real bastard, huh?~
@1889=~More like near feral. My mother was quite insane and my father is... well, let us just say that he was not available. So I was never properly socialized then. I lashed at everything around me, didn't speak to the other children, and was endless frustration to the matron and caretakers. It seems our kind don't get to have the luxury of loving families.~
@1890=~Hm... I mean to say people like us. Those not given the fortune of being dealt a comfortable and peaceful life by fate or the gods or just happenstance.~
@1891=~Ah. Well, let me hear about this Sir Cormysh.~
@1892=~Oh, ok. So this Sir Cormysh, I bet he was a real bastard, huh?~
@1893=~Sir Cormysh. He was a decorated old knight, retired from service but without a wife or children, so he offered to take on 'problem' children from the orphanage to 'correct'. The matron said I was as likely to die from his beatings as to become an upstanding proper young lady. He was a bogeyman in the orphanage, and I saw many boys wet themselves from fear at the mere thought of being sent his way.~
@1894=~Their fears were well founded. He was a harsh, often violent, man. In the orphanage, the rumors were that children were sent from the orphanage right into his oven for him to devour. That was a silly imagining of children, of course, but had a certain metaphorical truth to it. And of course, reports that at least a couple of the children he adopted had died in his care were also true, but well covered up.~
@1895=~And they just sent children to him? That's horrible.~
@1896=~The world is a harsh place. You learn or you die.~
@1897=~Orphanages only have so much space and food to give. Children who are too costly cannot be kept, and endanger the whole of the organization. There's a certain pragmatic cruelty to them shipping orphans off to this man. Their fate would be no better kicked back onto the street. Of course, most ran away from him and ended up there anyway.~
@1898=~I did not fear him though. I challenged him at every turn. Every lesson he gave, every exercise or drill he asked of me. But more than that, I excelled beyond all his other charges. Every time he beat me, I just smiled at him. Insult him even as his studded belt bit my bare skin.~
@1899=~No pain he could inflict would cower me. We came to an understanding in time. I was his spiteful masochistic bitch of a ward and he was my impotent feeble foster father. But we both needed one another. He educated me in society and war. I was the talented daughter he always wished for, finally a protégé strong enough to carry his legacy forward.~
@1900=~I'm so sorry. That's awful what you were put through.~
@1901=~That's incredibly messed up.~
@1902=~Certainly not a conventional father-daughter relationship. But I can see how you grew from it.~
@1903=~Indeed. Orphanages only have so much space and food to give. Children who are too costly cannot be kept, and endanger the whole of the organization. There's a certain pragmatic cruelty to them shipping orphans off to this man. Their fate would be no better kicked back onto the street. Of course, most ran away from him and ended up there anyway.~
@1904=~Oh pup, it was exactly what I required. You may see it as awful, but structure and education were rare gifts I'd never known before. Whatever punishment I received was not only fair trade, but better prepared me for my life ahead. So please, put your sympathies elsewhere.~
@1905=~I guess. It still makes me sick. I can't help that.~
@1906=~You're justifying your trauma. But that doesn't make it right, no matter what.~
@1907=~Fine. Consider them retracted.~
@1908=~I suppose so. I'll make no apologies for him. But it was what I needed then. Structure and education from someone who would never let me forget how cruel the world could be. But enough of that.~
@1909=~Most would not understand. I'm glad that you do. As bad as it sounds, I had it better than some. And I have no regrets about the woman it made me. But enough of that.~
@1910=~Oh spare me. I didn't choose to sit here and share a drink to suffer through your judgments. But enough of that.~
@1911=~My glass runs low, so I think this exchange of ours is coming quickly to a close. There is one last thing I wish to know from you, though. I've wondered it since I met you; since you started going on these hunts for me.~
@1912=~Your first kill.~
@1913=~My first kill? What about it?~
@1914=~Well this is getting morbid.~
@1915=~I know, I know, a rather macabre question. But an important one. Every hunter's journey begins with a kill. And it affects each of us differently. So who was yours?~
@1916=~It was an assassin. They attacked me in Candlekeep. I killed him defending myself.~
@1917=~Some low rent drunk with a shiv blade tried to kill me as I left Candlekeep. I killed him right back.~
@1918=~I feel like I can hardly remember anymore. Seems like a lifetime ago. But I believe it was an assassin that snuck into Candlekeep.~
@1919=~You were fortunate to live. In a fight between one who is willing to take a life against one for whom death is still a stranger, my money would go to the former. How did it make you feel, to kill him?~
@1920=~Nothing. I felt nothing at all.~
@1921=~It felt strange to me how shockingly easy it was to take another's life.~
@1922=~It wasn't pleasant. At the time I was just running on the adrenaline high of it. But afterwards I felt a pit in my stomach. Like something in me had changed forever.~
@1923=~I hated it. I still hate killing. It stains the soul.~
@1924=~Incredible. I had this rush run through me, like it was something I was born to do.~
@1925=~Who cares? I killed the bastard and there's nothing else to say about it.~
@1926=~That speaks volumes more than it might otherwise seem. But I think I understand. Most natural born killers feel the same. It comes so easily, and seems no different than any other mechanical action.~
@1927=~How about you? What was your first?~
@1928=~Woe to those who feel guilt from what could be such a simple thing.~
@1929=~Should it be that way, though? It feels like it should be different. More... important. Bad.~
@1930=~Truly? Oh, <CHARNAME>, then it seems fate was especially cruel to you.~
@1931=~It hasn't been especially pleasant. But maybe one day the killing can stop.~
@1932=~I think you very well were. 'Adventuring' is one way to chase that high, and I suspect that what made you take up that life so readil.~
@1933=~As long as there are people who need killing, I'll be there to kill them.~
@1934=~It matters more than you think. But a response like that is its own kind of answer.~
@1935=~My mother.~
@1936=~Err...~
@1937=~Huh.~
@1938=~Interesting.~
@1939=~She tried drowning me in a bath tub when I was eight summers of age. She had always accused me of being tainted by darkness, cursed, demon-spawn, abomination... the list goes on. As for how doing it made me feel...~
@1940=~I don’t even really remember my life before then. They’re like someone else’s memories, so distant that I recall the events but cannot conjure a single emotion to associate with them. No, my life started when I felt the spray of her blood on my face, the feel of it flowing down over my arm from where it gushed from the nail file I had stuck in her neck.~
@1941=~It's like I awoke then, and suddenly the world was rendered in sharp clarity around me.~
@1942=~I don't know what to say.~
@1943=~By the gods, that is dark.~
@1944=~Huh. Guess I had it pretty good, in retrospect.~
@1945=~There is nothing to say. It happened. I've moved on. I only thought I would share.~
@1946=~Darkness is inherent to this life. I just had the fortune of witnessing it early. It prepared me for that fundamental truth.~
@1947=~Perhaps. It is not worth giving much thought about.~
@1948=~And thus my glass has emptied. Thank you for entertaining my curiosity, <CHARNAME>, but I cannot stay longer.~ 
@1949=~So what's next for you?~
@1950=~Thank you for the drink, Illasera. This wasn't a terrible idea.~
@1951=~It was a pleasure. Perhaps we will do this again?~
@1952=~To Baldur's Gate. My quarries continue there. I expect you'll find your way there as well. Until then, good hunting. Be sure not to die.~
@1953=~It wasn't, despite my reservations about you at first. I will be heading to Baldur's Gate now. My quarries continue there. I expect you'll find your way there as well. Until then, good hunting. Be sure not to die.~
@1954=~The idea does not sound offensive to me. I will be heading to Baldur's Gate now. My quarries continue there. I expect you'll find your way there as well. Until then, good hunting. Be sure not to die.~
@1955=~Pup, I am the last person to ask that question of.~
@1956=~How about you? What was your first?~
@1957=~I guess it's just something I'll have to come to terms with.~
@1958=~Candlekeep seems like a perfectly dull place to have a childhood. How did you come out of that place with a personality to speak of?~
@1959=~You'd be surprised at the circus of characters there. Forgetful Phlydia or surly old Reevor. One of Keepers, Hull, would always get into drunken antics on the walls. Then there was the innkeeper, Winthrop who was always full of ribs and jests. And Imoen, of course. Her antics got us through a lot of boring days.~
@1960=~You'd be surprised at the circus of characters there. Forgetful Phlydia or surly old Reevor. One of Keepers, Hull, would always get into drunk antics. Then there was the innkeeper, Winthrop who was always full of ribs and jests. And Imoen, most importantly of all. Her antics got us through a lot of boring days. She's still with me even now.~
@1961=~The Watchers instilled our personality in us with long lectures and rigorous classwork.~
@1962=~Mostly by raising hells at every chance I could get. They'd have ironed it out of me at an early age, no doubt, if I didn't bash a few heads now and again.~
@1963=~What personality? Illasera, I am just a person-shaped golem. Your concept of 'humor' confuses and enrages me.~
@1964=~Your sentimentality is palpable. Hearing it makes me feel somehow both jealous and a tad nauseous. You were truly so fond of the place?~
@1965=~Yes, I was. I always was a bookish sort, so in some ways I could think of no better home on all Faerun.~
@1966=~Not always. It was a bit too stuffy and the scribes made sure that it was hard to get away with anything. But it was not a bad place to grow up.~
@1967=~No, I'm being sarcastic. The place was like the portal to the infinite plane of boredom.~
@1968=~In retrospect, it's hard to imagine a place could feel so safe. Now that my life feels in constant danger, I long to return to Candlekeep, as dull as it could be.~
@1969=~Not entirely. I always felt this low level of claustrophobia there. The walls always seemed so tight. It was more of a cage than a home. I'm glad to be gone from there.~
@1970=~Oh yes, the pink one. Her attitude seems childish and her loyalty to you much the same. I'll admit, there's something of substance there. Friends have never come easily to me, admittedly. But for Candlekeep itself, hearing you talk in such a glowing way makes me feel somehow both jealous and a tad nauseous. You were truly so fond of the place?~
@1971=~Tsch. Perhaps boredom begets a sense of humor at least. Like a defense mechanism. But I am serious, how was growing up there?~
@1972=~It was a bit too stuffy and the scribes made sure that it was hard to get away with anything. But it was not a bad place to grow up.~
@1973=~If anything, you're too kind about the place. Talk about a portal to the infinite plane of boredom.~
@1974=~I always felt this low level of claustrophobia there. The walls always seemed so tight. It was more of a cage than a home. I'm glad to be gone from there.~
@1975=~The only thing I hated more than the place were the people. Worthless lot, all of them. I'm glad to be rid of them.~
@1976=~Of course. You made your own fun then, the only way that fun could be had in such a banal fortress. I would have done much the same. If anything then, I am surprised you weren't thrown out. But I am serious, how was growing up there?~
@1977=~I actually quite enjoyed it. I always was a bookish sort, so in some ways I could think of no better home on all Faerun.~
@1978=~I suppose for those with a predisposition to learning through texts and literature, it would be something of a heaven. I do enjoy reading as well, but sitting in one place for too long would drive me to madness.~
@1979=~What about you? You said you hail from Sembia?~
@1980=~Where better could someone grow up?~
@1981=~Of course. There's a give and take with anything. You paint a picture of a place that was perfectly mediocre, but somehow you made it out and are at least slightly interesting.~
@1982=~What about you? You said you hail from Sembia?~
@1983=~I found a way. Who knows how I could have turned out if I grew up anywhere else.~
@1984=~My condolences to you. Surely it prepared you for a life of travel on the road though, at least.~
@1985=~Safety is a luxury few can afford. I've never known it for long, myself. I can see how you long for a return.~
@1986=~As a child, it seems especially important now. Who knows how I could have turned out if I grew up anywhere else.~
@1987=~This would explain why you've taken to the adventuring lifestyle so readily. I've always treasured my freedom among all else. I would be happy as well to be free from that cage.~
@1988=~Well pup, you hardly need concern yourself with them now. Put them out of your thoughts entirely, if they offend you so much. You're with me now, who I hope you find to be more agreeable company.~
@1989=~Yes. The capital city of Ordulin. It's a busy metropolis, much like nearby Baldur's Gate. Although instead of dukes, it is the Merchant Lords that govern the city. Sembia is a nation that lives and breathes by commerce, and Ordulin its beating heart.~
@1990=~Did you enjoy it there?~
@1991=~What's there to do in Ordulin?~
@1992=~Is there anything you miss most about home?~
@1993=~It sounds fine, though I've frankly no interest in it.~
@1994=~Sembia, where I hail from perhaps. Specifically, the capital city of Ordulin. It's a busy metropolis, much like nearby Baldur's Gate. Although instead of dukes, it is the Merchant Lords that govern the city. Sembia is a nation that lives and breathes by commerce, and Ordulin its beating heart.~
@1995=~If you had grown up in Ordulin, the capital of Sembia where I hail from, you would probably be more interested in enterprise than adventuring. It's a busy metropolis, much like nearby Baldur's Gate. Although instead of dukes, it is the Merchant Lords that govern the city. Sembia is a nation that lives and breathes by commerce, and Ordulin its beating heart.~
@1996=~At times. It is not an easy place to live for those without means. But if you have the coin, you will find your time there much more pleasant. More than anything though, it provided me opportunities. I was not restricted from the mage school there because of my upbringing, or rejected from mercenary companies because of my past.~
@1997=~I think we've talked about home long enough.~
@1998=~Everything, if you have the coin for it. There's few restrictions for what is acceptable to partake in. Drugs, sex, gambling, fight pits... I could go on. Almost anything commercial is permitted, save for slavery.~
@1999=~Hmm... I miss the smell. The merchants at their bakery and butcher stalls let their scents fill the air. It's most unlike the Sword Coast that always smells of fish and mud.~

// Illasera Act 2 Quests Blocks

@2000=~<CHARNAME>, good you came. Come, sit, I have someone to introduce you to.~
@2001=~Why did you ask me to come here, Illasera?~
@2002=~Are there more bounties to send me on?~
@2003=~<CHARNAME>, it brings a smile to my lips to see that you made it here safely. Come, can I get you anything to drink?~
@2004=~Aww, she likes us <CHARNAME>! I knew she'd warm up sooner or later.~
@2005=~You would not believe what I had to go through to get here...~
@2006=~Greetings Illasera. I received your summons and came as fast I could.~
@2007=~Yes, I think I could do with a refreshment.~
@2008=~No thanks. Who's the robed guy?~
@2009=~Even when I came north here, I have been keeping apprised of your activities. I found an opportunity that might help you.~
@2010=~Oh no, not more Red Wizards! I'm gonna just... hide over there. I'm totally not here.~
@2011=~Another Red Wizard? I was unaware of another operation...~
@2012=~This robed man here is Artin. He has some information that you may find useful.~
@2013=~I recognize his robes. This man is a Red Wizard.~
@2014=~You know him, Edwin?~
@2015=~Greetings, Artin. What kind of information do you have?~
@2016=~I do not like the look of this one. What information could you possibly have for me?~ 
@2017=~No, I believe my days of contracting you for bounties are over. I suspect you might be too busy for such things now. No, instead I would like to help you.~
@2018=~Hmmm... let me think. Did it involve slaying hundreds of bandits up and down the Sword Coast before delving deep into Cloakwood, facing all manner of beast and monster, to dismantle the operations of the mine there.~
@2019=~Well... yeah, that about covers it actually.~
@2020=~How are you so well informed?~
@2021=~That is one of the things I like about you best, <CHARNAME>. Your punctuality. But please, come and sit. Let me introduce you to someone.~
@2022=~Then a refreshment you will have. I'll order a round for the table when the server comes by next. First, let me introduce you to someone.~
@2023=~Right to business then? Very well. Let me introduce you...~
@2024=~You are amassing a rather impressive list of accomplishments. I am very so nearly impressed now.~
@2025=~One of these days you're just going to have to have to come out and say that you like me, Illasera.~
@2026=~Really? After all of that you're still not even a little impressed?~
@2027=~It is my job. I am very good at my job. I hope you do not find it overly invasive.~
@2028=~A little bit. But I don't know that you'd stop if I asked you.~
@2029=~Honestly, it more just makes me nervous that one of my enemies might know my steps as well as you seem to.~
@2030=~It could conceivably happen. I wouldn't recommend holding your breath for it. Let us get to business. I have someone to introduce you to.~
@2031=~Consider it lesson not to base your self-esteem in the approval of others. What I think shouldn't matter to you that much. Ah, but let us get to business. I have someone to introduce you to.~
@2032=~Not so long as you continue to be such an important figure in the region. Ah, but let us get to business. I have someone to introduce you to.~
@2033=~You should be. Likely, at least one of them does. Ah, but let us get to business. I have someone to introduce you to.~
@2034=~Wait, Artin. We are being watched.~
@2035=~You there. I see you glancing our way. Identify yourself at once!~
@2036=~Damn it!~
@2037=~What in the hells was that!?~
@2038=~So much for your lead. Not a great way to go out, gotta say.~
@2039=~It seems we had an assassin among us. The spiders killed Artin before he had a chance to react.~
@2040=~What a creative means of assassination. You have to give whoever responsible that.~
@2041=~Fascinating! I've never seen a living man be used as a conveyance of venomous spiders. I must make a note of it!~
@2042=~Egad! He died before I could reach 'em, the poor boy. I'll get ta performin' the funeral rites.~
@2043=~That was a foul way to die for the both of them.~
@2044=~Why can’t assassins just accost me in the open like normal?~
@2045=~So you don't happen to know what information he was going to share, do you?~
@2046=~Yes, quite gruesome. Was Artin always the target, or were the spiders a type of kill switch to prevent our spy from talking? Hm.~
@2047=~So what was the information he was going to share?~
@2048=~I imagine it is due to the fact that the success rate of prior assassins has been lacking. You would have to expect your enemies to try new tactics.~
@2049=~So what was the information he was going to share?~
@2050=~Tsch. Well...~
@2051=~You don’t know, do you?~
@2052=~I don't love that look.~
@2053=~He would not speak until the enemy of the Iron Throne arrived. I was merely a neutral party to facilitate the exchange. He felt he could not trust me with his secrets alone.~
@2054=~I would be discouraged, if I hadn't already prepared myself for inevitable disappointment.~
@2055=~Well that’s just great. So where do we go from here?~
@2056=~It sounds like whatever he said was important. With no other leads to go on, we need to find out who his killer was.~
@2057=~This is starting to become more trouble than it's worth. Why should I care?~
@2058=~Artin began to speak of meetings between his master and the Iron Throne. I've heard nary a whisper of Red Wizard activity in the city, so they've hidden themselves well. We do have one lead however. Artin's killer.~
@2059=~Not the whole of the Red Wizards. A splinter group. This must be investigated further! If they are traitors, they must be dealt with swiftly.~
@2060=~His assassination seems almost inspired by my kin. Or perhaps the assassin himself is also drow? How strange.~
@2061=~This magic is strange. A form of druidism unlike any I've seen.~
@2062=~This foul perversion of druidic magic could only have come from one person.~
@2063=~Jaheira? What do you mean?~
@2064=~Faldorn? You know who did this?~
@2065=~I recognize this magic as druidic, but twisted and dark. If anyone would know of it, it would be the Shadow Druids.~
@2066=~Hard to track a killer who wasn’t even at the scene. What do you suggest?~
@2067=~Artin began to speak of meetings between his master and the Iron Throne. I've heard nary a whisper of Red Wizard activity in the city, so they've hidden themselves well. We do have one lead however. Artin's killer.~
@2068=~My thinking exactly. You’ve come a long way since we first crossed paths in Beregost. So our first step is to discover who was behind this mystery assassin...~
@2069=~Keenly perceived. I'm unfamiliar with the exact magics myself, but I did suspect as much. Good to have you around to confirm it.~
@2070=~If my information is correct, there is a Shadow Druid enclave in Cloakwood, isn't there? I can think of no better line of inquiry than to ask the druids there.~
@2071=~The druids of those woods never were very agreeable to my clan. Or to anyone else, for that matter.~
@2072=~I had some dealings with the Shadow Druids on my way through Cloakwood. Perhaps after dealing with the mine there, they'll offer their help to me.~
@2073=~I'm afraid that the Shadow Druids may not be an option... we did not exactly leave on good terms.~
@2074=~First, we must identify the nature of the magic being used. Our assassin did leave behind one important piece of evidence... the bodies of these spiders. They've been magically altered. Knowing the nature of that magic might be our next step.~
@2075=~Take the body of the largest spider here to the Sorcerous Sundries. You'll find it just to the right as you exit the tavern. I understand the proprietor may have the necessary skillset and tools to assist you.~
@2076=~As good a place to start as anywhere. We'll return once we've asked him.~
@2077=~Return to me once you've found anything you can. I'll search among my own contacts to see if I can find anything.~
@2078=~*sigh* That makes things difficult.~
@2079=~As loathe as I am to call in this favor, it seems I may have no choice. A day's travel south-east of the city is a patch of forest called Peldvale. Between four small ponds is an unassuming tree.~
@2080=~There you will find a pair of dryads. Bring them the spider's body and inquire with them. Tell them I sent you, they should be forthcoming with details.~
@2081=~Oh Dryads! I must prepare a lovely sonnet for the occassion. Perhaps a little charm will earn their favor!~
@2082=~We must beware. Dryads can be fickle creatures, as likely to help common folk as they are to ensnare them in enchantments that make them their slaves.~
@2083=~How do you know these dryads?~
@2084=~Dryads are notoriously capricious creatures. I'm not sure that's going to work.~
@2085=~Me? Why don't you just do it?~
@2086=~Lets just call them a part of my extended group of contacts. I had business with them while in the area. It left them with a debt to me.~
@2087=~Dryads must make such fantastic friends! Think of all the trees you could climb together. How fun!~
@2088=~Dryads are notoriously capricious creatures. I'm not sure that's going to work.~
@2089=~Why don't you just do it?~
@2090=~Alright, I'll head down that way. Hopefully I'll have some answers from them.~
@2091=~True in most cases. But these two are more agreeable than most. Just remain respectful of their tree, and you'll be fine.~
@2092=~Why don't you just do it?~
@2093=~Because this is not my story, pup. I offered to help you, not take down the Iron Throne and save the region for you. I will continue to help with what info I have, but I have other business to attend to here in the meantime.~
@2094=~We trudge about in the mud while you stay here sipping your pansy elven wine. Figures.~
@2095=~Vic! Does a nosy musician ever come by here? One that gets a bit too close to your clientele, perhaps?~
@2096=~It sounds like this Nerys must be the woman to check. I would suggest the Three Old Kegs, as he says.~
@2097=~*sigh* Some Harpers just can't help but make the rest look bad.~
@2098=~That's it? She might just be a nosy patron, no reason to assume she's a Harper because of it.~
@2099=~Yeah that sounds like a Harper alright. I'll head that way and see what she knows.~
@2100=~True. But reason enough, given the options you have available to you. Unless you have a better place in mind to look, I think your direction is clear.~ 
@2101=~Go look into this Nerys and see if she can point you in the right direction. I will remain here, if you have other questions.~
@2102=~A Harper. If a Harper is in the area, then I believe our best lead is to find another Harper who might be aware of their movements. Since this Riezen doesn't seem to be the type of Harper that would stalk the cities.~
@2103=~I suspected that might be the nature of the magic, but it's good to have confirmation. Well then, it seems like you have a trip to Cloakwood ahead of you.~
@2104=~Ah, about that... I didn't exactly leave the Shadow Druids on good terms when I passed through there the first time. They may not be an option.~
@2105=~I doubt they'll be forthcoming with Jaheira among us. There has to be another option.~
@2106=~Not looking forward to trudging through that spider-infested wood again. But it seems I have little choice.~
@2107=~<CHARNAME>, good of you to come so quickly.~ 
@2108=~It seemed important. What did you find?~
@2109=~Well, I had this one keeping me company the whole way. So that was fun.~
@2110=~You -did- end up bringing the gnome along, did you? Oh wonderful.~
@2111=~Right. I've conferred with my contacts in the city and am trying to root out the location of the Red Wizards in the area. In the meantime, I've learned the identity of the Red Wizard's leader and her plans.~
@2112=~Knowing that could be a good first step to figuring out how to stop them. Good work.~
@2113=~This was worth calling me back right away for?~
@2114=~Do we really need to be tangling with the Red Wizards while the Iron Throne remains the real threat in the region?~
@2115=~Her name is Cherise Siltuhr, a former cultist of the Dead Three who found asylum in Thay after her lords were slaughtered a decade ago. She is a master conjurer and has collected a small army of monsters. A gift to the Iron Throne.~
@2116=~So no true born Thayan, then. It is inevitable that she would turn out to be a traitor.~
@2117=~My life keeps getting better and better...~
@2118=~Let them summon a whole damned horde of monsters. It won't stop me.~
@2119=~Alright, well we know the danger, now what I need are solutions.~
@2120=~It very well was. This Red Wizard's name is Cherise Siltuhr, a former cultist to the Dead Three who found asylum in Thay after her lords were slaughtered a decade ago. She is a master conjurer and has collected a small army of monsters. A gift to the Iron Throne.~
@2121=~Unfortunately, once you hear what I have to say, I think you'll agree that you have little choice in the matter.~
@2122=~The Red Wizard's leader is named Cherise Siltuhr, a former cultist to the Dead Three who found asylum in Thay after her lords were slaughtered a decade ago. She is a master conjurer and has collected a small army of monsters. A gift to the Iron Throne.~
@2123=~I think right now, you're best off still pursuing Darkeyes. He seems to be an enemy of theirs and might have some crucial missing piece of information we need to track them down.~
@2124=~Miss Nerys, your skill at parroting those with something important to say in the hopes of imbuing yourself with some significance is truly peerless.~
@2125=~You would be well advised not to allow your enemy to create a horde in the first place. Proaction will always have the advantage over reaction.~
@2126=~You mentioned a gorge. I believe I know the place you are referring to. North of Baldur's Gate, you'll find a series of farms. Head to the northmost farm, about half a day's travel, and then go north just a bit further. You'll find the gorge soon after.~
@2127=~Looks like I have my next target then. I'll give this place a knock and see if anyone's home.~
@2128=~What will you be doing in the meantime?~
@2129=~If it's so hidden, how did you know about it? In fact, if you knew about it, why didn't you send me there first? It seems like it should have been the obvious choice.~
@2130=~As always, return to me if you find anything. If he does not divulge what he knows, perhaps he has documents or writing that might illuminate this conspiracy.~
@2131=~Very well. I apologize, Nerys. I am sure you will make yourself a... valuable asset to this investigation.~
@2132=~I've yet to hear back from some of my contacts, so I need to remain in the city. Trust me in this, <CHARNAME>, I will not be idle.~
@2133=~Are you always going to be this suspicious of me? When it was revealed the nature of our target, I only had the vaguest suspicion the place existed. It was only in the meantime that I was able to confirm its location from my contacts. It was not worth mentioning until I knew for certain. Being half informed is often a greater liability than being uninformed.~
@2134=~What news? Did you find Riezen yet?~
@2135=~We did, but he forced us into a fight without divulging much. We had to kill him before we could learn anything of substance.~
@2136=~A shame, but it may not have been needed. Your timing is rather fortunate, it seems that Harper gnome may have found something. I received a missive from her shortly before you came here asking to meet her.~
@2137=~That's fantastic! Where do we need to meet her?~
@2138=~Lets hope the pipsqueak actually came through.~
@2139=~Ah but first, before I forget, a while ago now you gave me the spellbook of that necromancer, Sazazir. I was able to decipher some of his writings. The man may have been insane, but he was on the verge of some rather complex incantations. I've completed the missing components and scribed them into scrolls for you. Free to use or sell as you see fit.~
@2140=~The second thing I ask; did you find any kind of journal or diary or any writing at all on Riezen that we might be able to use? It could have the clues we need.~
@2141=~I do. It's all in some kind of code though. Perhaps you would have better luck with it?~
@2142=~Oh I uh, may have missed that. Or I might have sold it with some other junk. I don't have it with me now.~
@2143=~(lie) No, I didn't find anything like that on him.~
@2144=~(lie) No, I uhh... didn't find anything like that on him.~
@2145=~Yes, I'll just take a look at that. Hm. Heavily coded. Riezen was quite paranoid it seems. Goes along with being a Harper, I guess. I'll get to work decoding this in my spare time then. Oh what secrets did you hoard, Riezen... ah, but knowledge like this is a prize greater than gold. You've earned a share of mine for giving this treasure to me. Go ahead and take it.~
@2146=~<CHARNAME>, you can be such a witless idiot sometimes. Ugh, forget it.~
@2147=~Damn. I was certain he would have something. Ah well, nothing to be done about it then.~
@2148=~No? Really now? Tsch, do not think yourself so clever, <CHARNAME>, I know when someone is hiding something from me. But I'll not force the matter.~
@2149=~Now then, Nerys sent this missive a few hours ago. In it, she requests to meet you up the stairs just past the inner walls of the city, by a small establishment called the Drakon Tavern. She requests to meet after nightfall. So dramatic.~
@2150=~Say no more, we'll meet her there.~
@2151=~Did she say what she found?~
@2152=~She remained vague in the missive. But it seems she did stick that rather large nose of hers into some Red Wizard business and at least knows to some extent their operation. Regardless, you should hurry. This opportunity may not be present for long.~
@2153=~Do hurry. The gnome may be resourceful, but she lacks the subtlety required to live a long life in the profession she's chosen. Best to make use of her talents while they're available.~
@2154=~<CHARNAME>, this is the part where you tell me that Nerys told you where Cherise is hiding, you swooped down and slayed the witch, and toppled the Iron Throne in the process.~
@2155=~Stop this prattle. I detest sarcasm.~
@2156=~You didn't hear? I also saved the Dukes from a dragon, brokered peace with Amn, and taught a devil how to love.~
@2157=~Nerys was kidnapped.~
@2158=~And thus your legend grows... So who got to her? Is she still alive?~
@2159=~She's being held hostage. The man who told me mentioned the name 'Night Knives'. That familiar to you?~
@2160=~You're always one step ahead, aren't you?~
@2161=~It isn't the most unsurprising thing I've heard lately. For a spy, she's rather lacks in talent or experience.~
@2162=~Aww, she's tryin' her best. We just gotta give her some pointers is all.~
@2163=~The man who told me mentioned the name 'Night Knives'. That familiar to you?~
@2164=~The Night Knives? Well isn't that interesting.~
@2165=~You know about them? Who are they?~
@2166=~Do you know where they might have set up?~
@2167=~We need to save Nerys. She's our only lead to the Red Wizards now.~
@2168=~We need to save Nerys. I don't like the thought of her in trouble.~
@2169=~In my trade, you learn to always expect the worst. And it's hard to expect anything but the worst when it comes ta someone so clearly out of their depth than that gnome.~
@2170=~I am well familiar with them. The Night Knives are a thieving guild that operate out of my homeland, Sembia. It's unusual that they would operate so far from Selgaunt, especially on the territory of another guild. But we shouldn't be surprised by the reach of the Red Wizards.~
@2171=~They mostly persist on smuggling, assassination, and petty larceny. Also kidnapping, it would seem. The guildmaster is a particularly distasteful little man who I've heard is not above consorting with demons and undead.~
@2172=~I've heard some rather unsavory things from former members; that he made a deal with a local Vampire lord to "gift" certain guild members with his bite. Sometimes willingly, often not.~
@2173=~You mean we could be dealing with Vampires?~
@2174=~I don't. They can't have been in the city long. Perhaps hired on by the Red Wizards to assist them in more underhanded matters?~
@2175=~It seems our hand is forced in the matter, regardless. The Night Knives could not have come into the city without attracting the attention of the entrenched thief guild. If you've had dealings with them in the past, I might suggest going to the local guildmaster and inquiring with him.~
@2176=~Alternatively, if you'd rather keep your hands clean of criminal elements in the city, you're assisting the Flaming Fist, are you not? Perhaps they've had run ins with them. Or just knock down every door in the city until you find them. I'm sure you'll find a way.~
@2177=~No, not true vampires. Vampire spawn or lesser thralls. More resilient than normal men, but pale imitations of their sire.~
@2178=~Vampires?? Oh, do not be scared Boo. I will protect you. We must only avoid their sharp, pointy teeth!~
@2179=~I believe that burning in my ears means that I am being summoned? Don't faint with surprise that I am alive and well.~ 
@2180=~<CHARNAME>, I assume you wiped out that rat’s nest the Red Wizards were hiding in?~
@2181=~We slayed every last one of them! You missed out on the fun.~
@2182=~I did. Except for their leader, who escaped looking into another threat. Which begs the question of what exactly you were doing.~
@2183=~Damn it, your actions may have just denied my chance to cut off the snake’s head. What in the hells were you doing?~
@2184=~Handily, save that Cherise herself escaped to attend to another sudden issue. I assume you found another angle of attack and decided to take it?~
@2185=~Why, assaulting her true lair, of course.~
@2186=~I have to admit, I feel a bit used. Not that I mind being used for a lady's pleasure necessarily.~
@2187=~Explain.~
@2188=~I'm not in the mood for glib words right now. What are you up to?~
@2189=~She had another lair? Wait, how long have you known that?~
@2190=~Well aren't you sly. Yes, it was indeed I that called her attention when I trespassed on her true lair.~
@2191=~I have to admit, I feel a bit used. Not that I mind being used for a lady's pleasure necessarily.~
@2192=~So she had another lair? How long have you known that?~
@2193=~So I was just a distraction then for you?~
@2194=~Of course. I had suspected the Red Wizards might be operating extra-dimensionally. If the monsters they have collected are as exotic as I believe, they could not have moved them locally without attracting attention. Holding them outside of the material plane is the most obvious choice.~
@2195=~How do you figure? Couldn't they just summon them from some dungeon in Thay?~
@2196=~How did you find this extra dimensional base?~
@2197=~Why didn't you tell me?~
@2198=~Well, thank you for the assist... I think. What happened in there? Did you face Cherise?~
@2199=~I had suspected the Red Wizards might be operating extra-dimensionally. If the monsters they have collected are as exotic as I believe, they could not have moved them locally without attracting attention. A pocket dimension is the most obvious choice.~
@2200=~Oh, it's not like that, pup. I had suspected the Red Wizards might be operating extra-dimensionally. If the monsters they have collected are as exotic as I believe, they could not have moved them locally without attracting attention. Holding them outside of the material plane is the most obvious choice.~
@2201=~Unlikely. Teleportation over long physical distances is imprecise and you would not want your hordes of ravenous and barely controlled creatures to appear a league away from where you intend them.~	
@2202=~So maybe a two-way portal you might ask? Possible, but that is a ritual typically beyond the power of one mage and would leave a powerful magical signature in the area, something I have not detected. It seems the number of actual wizards in this group is too low to sustain such a thing, regardless.~
@2203=~But, storing your stock in another dimension close at hand? Far easier, safer, and able to be done more subtly. It's the obvious choice, really.~
@2204=~I have the late Artin to thank for that. I have mentioned I am an accomplished tracker? That extends to tracking across dimensional barriers as well as physical ones. His robes contained arcane residue that I was able to trace.~
@2205=~Because I did not wish to waste your time on what was, at the time I started investigating, an untested suspicion. If I thought it would help in your own quest, I would have informed you.~
@2206=~You got me involved in this, now you’re withholding information? You make it very hard to trust you, Illasera.~
@2207=~No. I won't continue to work with someone who is operating behind my back. Do I make myself clear?~
@2208=~I can understand that, I suppose. I’ll defer to your judgment. What happened when you attacked?~
@2209=~I understand. As difficult as it is for me to say this, I apologize. Perhaps I'm too used to working on my own, unaccountable to anyone but myself and my employer. I will keep you better in mind in the future.~
@2210=~I still have to protect the privacy of my contacts and client, but in anything related to your mission against the Iron Throne, I will be more.... forthright.~
@2211=~Good. Thank you. So what happened in there?~
@2212=~I'm going to hold you to that. So what happened in there?~
@2213=~And you've shown little interest in offering your own trust. I hardly have any ill will toward you for it, trust is a fool's commodity. You'd be smart not to trust me any further than you can be sure our interests coincide with one another.~
@2214=~But, if nothing else, trust that my actions will aid in your deposing of the Iron Throne. And I will trust you to follow this path, as your life very much depends on it. That is all that is necessary.~
@2215=~It will have to do. So what happened in there?~
@2216=~Fine. At least there are no illusions about where the other stands. So what happened in there?~
@2217=~You've made yourself quite clear, but I will not be talked down to by some sheltered, fumbling id...~
@2218=~*sigh* No, I am too close to my goal, I'll not let my personal feelings get in the way of things. Be assured my actions will only serve to aid in your deposing the Iron Throne. That is all that is necessary.~
@2219=~I arrived to see that Cherise was keeping her beasts in a pacified state. A clever way to keep them in line until she was ready to hand them off for whatever the Iron Throne has planned, but it also rendered them completely vulnerable inside.~
@2220=~I began to kill them in their slumbering condition, one at a time. It would have been short work, but I was interrupted by Cherise herself. While I had veiled myself from magical detection, it seems that killing her creatures had triggered an alarm.~
@2221=~We engaged in a magical battle. You should consider yourself lucky I diverted her away from you. Her magical prowess was quite considerable.~
@2222=~Of course, she is a Red Wizard. Even though not a natural born Thay, if her talents purchased her a place among my kin, they must be quite proficient.~
@2223=~But you were able to keep up with her?~
@2224=~I expect you had some tricks up your sleeve.~
@2225=~Of course. In terms of raw magical prowess, she may have exceeded my own abilities. But I had set several warding traps beforehand as a precaution and made certain that several of my arrows were enchanted to unravel magical protections.~
@2226=~In an act of desperation, she dispelled the hold she had placed over her creatures, freeing them all at once. That turned the tides against me. Regrettably, I had to hasten a retreat.~
@2227=~Can you just imagine the dramatic interpretation done in a play?! There'd be so many costumes, so many props and effects! Oh, I need to commit this to page now before I forget any of it!~
@2228=~I'm glad you got out when you could. That could have turned deadly very fast.~
@2229=~Unfortunate that you weren't able to take care of her. Can we follow up with another attack?~
@2230=~Send me in then. I'll finish up what you started.~
@2231=~I have to admit, cowardice isn't exactly what I expected from the greatest Bounty Hunter in the Heartlands.~
@2232=~Yes, it could have. But I've learned to read the tide of a battle. I didn't get to where I am by risking my life recklessly. And your... concern is noted and not entirely unappreciated.~
@2233=~She likes us. See, told ya <CHARNAME>!~
@2234=~So what's next? We all go in and finish the job?~
@2235=~We should regroup and re-assess our options.~
@2236=~Not possible. After I found my escape from her realm, I could feel the boundaries between us seal shut and lock. She has likely created wards specifically to prevent me from getting in again. That puts her beyond our reach for now.~
@2237=~But we have disrupted her plans significantly. Her other Red Wizard associates are all dead and with her monsters loose in her domain, she'll likely be tied up for some time trying to regain control of them. I wouldn't be surprised if most of this 'horde' devours itself before she can pacify them.~
@2238=~She remains a threat that can't be ignored, but it would be wise to hold back for the moment. I still need to find a way to breach back into her domain when we are ready again. Did you find anything of interest in their lair?~
@2239=~I found this crystal. It seems magical somehow. Maybe that might help?~
@2240=~The fool who cannot tell cleverness for cowardice is unlikely to learn until it's too late. Remember that <CHARNAME>.~
@2241=~You show your cunning yet again, <CHARNAME>. I think most in your position would assume it's best to press the attack.~
@2242=~Let me take a look at it.~
@2243=~Yes, this looks to be a magical key of some kind. See how it glows? The frequency is tune with the same magical signature I used to pierce into Cherise's domain.~
@2244=~I'll need some time to determine how to get back in, as well as formulate a plan. It may be a good time for you to continue your investigation into the Iron Throne. If you have any need to take some time away from the city, now would not be a bad time to do it. I don't expect I'll be ready for days or even weeks.~
@2245=~Weeks? Will it really take you so long?~
@2246=~Are you still so sure you won't come with me? You could do your research while we travel.~
@2247=~Yes, the Flaming Fist has some more leads I need to follow. They'll probably be unhappy if I delay much longer, anyway.~
@2248=~Unfortunately so. Now that Cherise knows of our efforts against her, she will ensure that we cannot breach her sanctum again so easily. Ah, as much as I know your preferred tactic is to rush headlong into danger, I think caution is the better course this time. I'll be in touch when the time to strike comes again.~
@2249=~I enjoyed the last time we sat and had a drink together. Before we part, would you like to share another with me?~
@2250=~Then I'll continue in my investigations. I expect you'll be in touch.~
@2251=~The thought of toppling the Iron Throne to the ground while sharing your company is almost enough to convince me. But no. I still have too much to do here, unrelated to your goals. I'm afraid you will need to continue without me.~
@2252=~Try not to allow them to boss you around too much. Law enforcement is a nagging spouse, does little but never ceases to tell you how you do your own job wrong.~
@2253=~As I always am. Be safe, <CHARNAME>.~
@2254=~You want to have a drink with me? Even though there's important work to do? Don't you think...~
@2255=~Ah, what am I saying? Of course, a drink sounds wonderful. I rather enjoyed our last chat and arcane duels always leave me feeling parched.~
@2256=~Mmm Nerys?~
@2257=~Could you come up with us and play some music while we drink? If your harping is better than your harpering, that is.~
@2258=~Wonderful. Come, <CHARNAME>, let us grab a table upstairs in one of the side rooms.~

// Illasera bar scene 2

@2259=~Something melodic and a touch somber if you can manage it.~
@2260=~Hmm... yes, that will do. Thank you Nerys.~
@2261=~So we meet again over a drink, <CHARNAME>. Although I feel you've changed so much since the last time we chatted like this. I can no longer rightly call you a tender pup. You've matured into a seasoned adventurer... a grown wolf to be feared.~
@2262=~So I won't have to endure you calling me a 'pup' anymore? About time.~
@2263=~I've actually grown fond of it now. It's endearing.~
@2264=~It's been a journey. You're right, it changes you. Sometimes I wonder if I'm even the same person as when I started it.~
@2265=~I don't actually feel that different. As much as people say that adventuring changes you, I feel the same as I did exiting the gates of Candlekeep.~
@2266=~I don't really think about the person I was or am that much. Living this life doesn't give much time for introspection.~
@2267=~*chuckles* I suppose so. Unless you make some bumbling mistake that convinces me otherwise. Just because we share pleasant conversation, don't think you're forever beyond my contempt.~
@2268=~It's been a journey. You're right, it changes you. Sometimes I wonder if I'm even the same person as when I started it.~
@2269=~I don't actually feel that different. As much as people say that adventuring changes you, I feel the same as I did exiting the gates of Candlekeep.~
@2270=~I don't really think about the person I was or am that much. Living this life doesn't give much time for introspection.~
@2271=~A bit intimate, don't you think? No, whether you like it or not, you've outgrown my casual condescension.~
@2272=~It's been a journey. You're right, it changes you. Sometimes I wonder if I'm even the same person as when I started it.~
@2273=~You aren't. This life tears you down and rebuilds you over and over and over again. Each time a little bit wiser, a little bit stronger, disabused from notions of innocence and safety in this world.~
@2274=~I agree. Innocence is all too often a crutch by those who cannot deal with the world as it is.~
@2275=~Oh I wouldn't want to give up my innocence entirely. There's something to be said for preserving some bit of childlike wonder at the world.~
@2276=~Illasera, I fight for that innocence and safety. Maybe my life doesn't afford me such luxuries, but it's important to me that I strive to give it to others.~
@2277=~Do you really believe that? How can you grow without shedding some of what you were?~
@2278=~It's important for me to not forget where I came from. The very best parts of myself came from there, and I take them still with me today.~
@2279=~I don't think that people fundamentally change all that much, Illasera. Whatever I was yesterday, I will be tomorrow. That goes for you too.~
@2280=~Candlekeep taught me what I consider to be the strongest facets of myself. I would become lesser by allowing my journey to change me.~
@2281=~Truly? You don't spare moments of quiet for yourself when you came for the night? How else do you spend the mundane hours of travel than in thought?~
@2282=~I spend them concentrating on the path up ahead, on the lookout for danger and managing supplies. When I camp, exhaustion wins out over introspection.~
@2283=~I keep myself entertained enough that I don't need to think about things too much. Reading, conversing, enjoying art and nature. You can find plenty to keep busy even during the long hours of travel.~
@2284=~I just don't like to navel gaze. It's pretentious.~
@2285=~Leading them to be ill prepared when the horrors of reality set in. You look around and see all these common folk crying out for a hero. Perhaps if they spent more time preparing themselves for the inevitable, they'd have the resilience to persevere instead of waiting for a 'hero' to fix their problems for them.~
@2286=~It would make our lives a lot more boring though if everyone handled their own problems though, no?~
@2287=~So, lead by example. A few of them will get it. It's the best we can do.~
@2288=~I frankly don't give a whit about the cries of the common folk. Kings, nobles, and merchants on the other hand? Let them continue to be plagued by ill fortune so long as they have gold to throw my way to fix it.~
@2289=~That's the place of the common folk though. If they were uncommon, they'd be, well, us.~
@2290=~An unnecessary and overly romantic notion of innocence, if you ask me. I appreciate the world just fine without preserving that childish ignorance.~
@2291=~Do you though? When is the last time you admired some piece of art or nature and just marveled at how it could all come together so?~
@2292=~You know, sometimes you sound like an old crone.~
@2293=~Oh come now, you've got a bit of a spritely lass in you still, I'm sure of it. You just need the right situation to bring it out.~
@2294=~And I'll never stop calling you a fool for it. Look around and see all these common folk crying out for a hero. Perhaps if they spent more time preparing themselves for the inevitable, they'd have the resilience to persevere instead of waiting for a 'hero' to fix their problems for them.~
@2295=~Maybe a hero just needs to rise up first to inspire them.~
@2296=~The world doesn't work like that. People aren't weak from a lack of desire to be strong. We all have our roles to fill.~
@2297=~Everyone needs a little help Illasera. Even you didn't get to where you are without a little help on the way.~
@2298=~I suppose you had more... fertile ground to grow from at least, if you'll forgive the metaphor. Not all can say they were raised in a place like Candlekeep. I used to believe that made you weak. I've been reconsidering.~
@2299=~Exactly. Gorion and the others there impressed upon me the valuable lessons I'd need to thrive even now. I will never forget those teachings.~
@2300=~No where else in the Realms could produce a person like me, frankly. I am a product of my training and discipline.~
@2301=~That's not to say I'm entirely uninfluenced by my travels. Just that I think I forged a core there that was unchangeable. Everything else is just extra.~
@2302=~Many things do not change, I will agree to that. But there are things we learn about ourselves and our origins that alter our perspectives, that shake our identity. I wonder if one day you will have such an experience.~
@2303=~It hasn't happened yet, even after being chased from my home, watching my foster father die, and battling hordes of bandits and monsters to get here. If that didn't do it, I can't imagine what will.~
@2304=~It sounds like you've had something of an experience in that. Anything you'd like to share?~
@2305=~That's rather ominous. Is there something on the horizon I don't know about?~
@2306=~Tsch, all business then? At least you'd be a moderately tolerable traveling companion. I've never been one for chatter on the roads.~
@2307=~The road has many dangers and I'll not let myself be killed out of carelessness.~ 
@2308=~You're still welcome to come with me, you know. I would value your skill and experience.~
@2309=~You sound as if you skip along the road, singing sonnets as you go. Gag me, that sounds absolutely insufferable.~
@2310=~Oh not all that, no. I'm rather quiet out on the road actually, I just make sure I'm busied accordingly.~
@2311=~Come now. You have to find ways to amuse yourself on the road. Keeping away the more tedious aspects of adventuring is practically a talent of its own.~
@2312=~Ha! Illasera, you should try prancing along in the woods with me. It would surely brighten your dour demeanor.~
@2313=~Oh my, I feel quite called out all of a sudden. I imagine you think me quite the self-absorbed fool.~
@2314=~You are what you are. There's no use thinking about it. That's all.~
@2315=~I'm sure your ego can take the hit.~
@2316=~Not all that much. I do believe our conversations have been about me as much as you, if not more so.~
@2317=~Hmph. Fair enough. Though I'd like to think I'd find some ways of keeping things lively for myself.~
@2318=~If you truly care about what most others think or do, I suppose so. It’s none of my concern.~
@2319=~Well said. You’ve truly embraced the entrepreneurial spirit of a hunter.~
@2320=~Hmm, true enough. I suppose trying to compare them by our standards is quite unrealistic of me.~
@2321=~Art has its place. I do not admit this to many, but I enjoy painting in my spare time. Landscapes. I strive towards realism, to capture the way that the natural world fits together. No fancy, no exaggeration. The world doesn't need more falsehoods masquerading as art in it.~
@2322=~And what is so wrong with that? Crones are typically thought of as wise. So long as I do not look like one, I’ll accept the compliment.~
@2323=~If you wish for me at my most merry, you have it in front of you now. If you're looking for more than this, you may just as well look for a charitable devil.~
@2324=~Helped? Oh, they helped -themselves- to me, most certainly. My naivete, my eagerness to impress, whatever scraps of innocence I still had left from my childhood. No, everything of worth to me I earned and whatever ‘help’ I received was only a transaction in disguise.~
@2325=~He must have been an impressive mentor. You could benefit to step out of his shadow more, however.~
@2326=~Admirable, just so long as you allow a degree of flexibility. You’ve only begun to encounter the forces that will try to change you. If you do not bend a certain amount, even to resist them, you will break. Mark my words.~
@2327=~No. That’s as private as things get for me. Don’t be offended, as comfortable as I am during our chats, some aspects of myself will be forever closed to the outside.~
@2328=~I know you stand just before the precipice to something bigger than you can imagine. All this with the Iron Throne... it’s just the beginning. You must see that.~
@2329=~I’m grateful then that you’re not so reticent with me.~
@2330=~You know my feelings on that, <CHARNAME>. But... if ever circumstances changed... never say never, as they say.~
@2331=~I am certain whatever company you keep is ever thankful for that.~
@2332=~I suppose you are not wrong. Boredom has spelled the end of more adventuring careers than any trap or monster.~
@2333=~I will disagree, but there seems little shared ground here worth discussing.~
@2334=~Indeed it can. In fact, I even find it refreshing to be called out so plainly.~
@2335=~Of course. I am trying to discern your weaknesses while not divulging my own, afterall. I thought that you were aware of the rules of this game we play.~
@2336=~But my point is that, like it or not, you've shaped the face of the Sword Coast. Your name is spoken of in taverns and markets. I've even heard a few middling compositions from bards looking to piggy-back on your fame to retell some of your adventures.~
@2337=~What about you? You've said you're renowned in the Eastern Heartlands. Surely you've had plenty of adventures that are sung about in taverns. Some maybe even competently!~
@2338=~That's the curse of the adventuring life, isn't it? Always hangers on looking to profit from your accolades.~
@2339=~I'm sure you're all too familiar with that.~
@2340=~Tsch, I won't speak to the quality of the bards there. My own adventures tended to garner less attention than yours have. I've raided a few tombs and delved a few dungeons before, however.~
@2341=~Are there any that have stood out to you? You know all about my adventures it seems, but I don't know any of yours.~
@2342=~Garner less attention? Sounds like an evasive way of saying that yours haven't stacked up.~
@2343=~Do you prefer adventuring or hunting?~
@2344=~True, though my own adventures tended to garner less attention than yours have. I've raided a few tombs and delved a few dungeons before, however.~
@2345=~My adventures? Hm. Let me think.~
@2346=~Please. I just don't feel the need to broadcast my achievements so obviously. Perhaps you need an example? Let me think~
@2347=~Hunting, by and large. I'm simply more adept at the craft of it. Though, there have been a few adventures I've had of note. Hrm. Let me think.~
@2348=~There was this one adventure, a rescue mission, to save the scion of a noble family from imprisonment.~
@2349=~Not a typical prison break. For this mission, I had to delve into the depths of Tartarus itself to free him.~
@2350=~You went to Carceri?~
@2351=~I think I’ve heard of it. Some kind of prison beyond the mortal realm?~
@2352=~A Tartar sauce?~
@2353=~Sounds like a ridiculous start to a tall-tale.~
@2354=~Yes, it is called that among scholars. Are you knowledgeable in planar lore? If so, I trust I don’t have to tell you just how dangerous it is.~ 
@2355=~I’ve some cursory knowledge but wouldn’t mind a refresher.~
@2356=~How did he end up there?~
@2357=~You must have been offered quite a lot of coin to take a mission so dangerous.~
@2358=~In essence, though your description is insufficient to describe its scope. It is known among planar scholars as Carceri, and it is not just “a” prison, it is “The” Prison. It is an entire plane of existence for those who were criminals, betrayers, and deceivers in life.~
@2359=~Tartarus, and it also goes by the name ‘Carceri’, is an entire plane of existence for those who were criminals, betrayers, and deceivers in life. It is The Prison of the Planes.~
@2360=~Carceri is usually referred to as the Prison of the Planes, a place where the souls of criminals, betrayers, and deceivers go. There they seethe against often absent jailors and chains of their own making while continuing to habitually lie, cheat, and steal.~
@2361=~I hardly blame you for thinking so. It is as exotic as missions get. Now would you care to hear my telling or would you rather think me the liar and skip this ‘tall-tale’ as you say?~
@2362=~No no, go on. I was just expressing my disbelief. Tell me about your mission.~
@2363=~I don’t care to hear it. A bard would make a better audience.~
@2364=~To begin with, the Scion's family was involved in a 3-way war for a stretch of fertile land. His family made an alliance with one under the understanding that they would consolidate power and destroy the third.~
@2365=~The alliance was a trick, used to lure the other family's into a hopeless battle that slaughtered them all. Yet this cross was compounded by the trickery of the third family who abducted the scion. They paid a powerful mage to banish him to Tartarus. Betrayal on top of betrayal, not so uncommon in Sembian politics.~
@2366=~They knew his father, the Duke, would stop at nothing to retrieve his son, even if it meant the bankruptcy his estate. Indeed, the cost of funding our team and the magical artifacts needed to conduct the rescue mission ensured the future dissolution of his nobility.~
@2367=~A sordid state of affairs. What convinced you to take on a job so dangerous?~
@2368=~It wasn't the coin that convinced me. It was the challenge and... something else. A calling I felt, perhaps. In truth, I had been going through a bit of an existential crisis then as well, taking on jobs more dangerous than a prudent hunter would risk. Anything that brought me close enough to death to feel it's cold breath on my neck.~
@2369=~It was no small significant amount of coin on offer though. That certainly didn't hurt my decision to go.~
@2370=~In experience, I was roughly where you are now; seasoned on a few delves and hunts, but with much further room for growth.~
@2371=~So how did this man end up in the outer planes of all places?~
@2372=~It wasn't the coin that convinced me. It was the challenge and... something else. A calling I felt, perhaps. In truth, I had been going through a bit of an existential crisis then as well, taking on jobs more dangerous than a prudent hunter would risk. Anything that brought me close enough to death to feel it's cold breath on my neck.~
@2373=~So you were motivated to go. What then?~
@2374=~There were six of us called onto the mission. We were each given a Golden Band, which when activated would transport the wearer back to Faerun after we had secured our target. We formulated a plan and then the portal was opened.~
@2375=~I have no poet's voice to describe Carceri. It was strange and unsettling, a pitch black sky save for the glowing red orb of another world hanging precipitously overhead, like a guillotine ready to fall.~
@2376=~The only light came from the ground itself, which cast an eerie red glow upwards. Besides that, it was a twisted reflection of the world around you. All mountains were sheer jagged cliffs, all plants were lined with thorns that cut like razors, and every shadow around us seemed to conceal a predator.~
@2377=~Fascinating. I would have enjoyed seeing such a fantastic sight, even despite the danger.~
@2378=~Yeah, remind me to never go there.~
@2379=~Our objective was the Forlorn Bastille, a fortress that was supposedly created from the skeletal remains of a Titan. We could not arrive within the fortress, for it was magically sealed against such incursions, so we had to arrive nearby and make our way there.~
@2380=~Trouble began immediately. We arrived off course, further off than intended. We kept low and quiet, making our way with care. One of our group was an arcanist with a shaved head that was decorated with runes. She guided us as best she could. She was our 'expert' on planar lore.~
@2381=~While we avoided tall grass where we could, we reached a great stretch of savannah for which there seemed no way around. Our leader, a decorated war veteran with grey temples and a crooked nose, decided we would need to chance it. We took a length rope and wrapped it around each of our waists as the grass was too thick and tall for us to see one another.~
@2382=~Everything was quiet as we proceeded and things seemed to go fine. But when we arrived on the other side, the rope that had been tethered to our arcanist had been torn, and she was nowhere to be found. However she had been taken, she must have not even been given the chance to cry out to alert us. We were down to five.~
@2383=~Frightening. I can't imagine how disturbed you must have all been.~
@2384=~And you didn't even try to go back for her?~
@2385=~Perhaps she made it out somehow. You can never know for sure.~
@2386=~Quite so. That one of us could be picked off an hour ago without any of the rest of us knowing, it was disquieting.~
@2387=~What could be done? There was no trace of her for us to track and the field of grass she'd been lost in spanned a dozen leagues. Was it worth putting the rest of our lives at risk? We could only continue on.~
@2388=~I hope you don't take that optimism with you to games of card and dice <CHARNAME>.~
@2389=~Twice we were attacked by Demodands, natives of the plane, but they seemed to expect weak prey. They would scare off after only one or two of their number were felled. We evaded the stronger fiends, ducking out of sight when we noticed them flying overhead.~
@2390=~We continued on, though I noticed soon that the plane itself seemed to be effecting me. Whenever I would make small talk, I would speak a dozen little lies without meaning to. I knew my companions were doing the same. Each time they looked at me, I could feel them sizing me up, as if to gauge how they might dispatch me. I didn't know then how much my paranoia was my own, or just the plane's effect on me.~
@2391=~One of our number, a silverhaired priest of Malar, stopped us suddenly with a scream. He pointed his sword at our burglar, a weaselly sharp-nosed man with a jeweled dagger, claiming that he had caught him attempting to steal his band.~
@2392=~He became erratic, unreasonable, and then lunged forward. The barbarian in our group, a man half again my height and armed with an obsidian bladed axe, swung to intercept. Our priest was split apart. The strike had also damaged his golden band beyond use. Now we were four.~
@2393=~What a vile place that it could turn you against one another like that.~
@2394=~What a pointless way to die.~
@2395=~Better off without him. Even if he didn't attack you, his hysterics would have drawn more attention to you.~
@2396=~The Lower Planes are dangerous for a number of reasons. Their effect on you can be insidious and more deadly than any fiend.~
@2397=~Indeed. It happened so quickly that I hardly had time to process what was happening. And then we continued on as if nothing had happened at all.~
@2398=~There is a pragmatic truth to that. I think our barbarian's action, even if shocking, was probably the correct one. Our leader was not happy with it, but we were in too deep to debate it.~
@2399=~We arrived before the fortress without further incident. It was well guarded by a faction of planar law enforcers called the Mercykillers, a notoriously grim organization. We decided the best course of entry was to disguise ourselves as planar bounty hunters, trying to locate a serial murderer from our world who had escaped into the area.~
@2400=~While charity is a little practiced virtue of the Mercykillers, they do offer shelter to those who hunt criminals. Armed as we were, we were clearly neither natives nor petitioners, so they allowed us in. We were guided to a bunkroom within the complex under careful guard.~
@2401=~We carefully evaluated the movement of the jail's wardens as best we could, and when a chance came, we dispatched the guards that had been given watch over us. We hurried down into the dungeons where our target was being held. On the way, we were waylaid by a patrol of wardens who charged our leader.~
@2402=~Dozens of the heavily armored wardens fell before us, yet their number was considerable. It became clear that we were mired. Our leader commanded myself and our burglar to proceed downward while he and our barbarian held our rear. I heard the ringing of sword on shield before a guttural cry echoed through those ossein chambers. Only two remained.~
@2403=~He did as the leader should, protecting the group to his last. I could only hope to do the same.~
@2404=~Prospects of accomplishing your mission now must have been especially dim then.~
@2405=~Why risk yourself to rescue such a bastard? It's a pointless sacrifice.~
@2406=~Don't be so quick to throw away your life. There's always a third way. Still, I respect his professionalism if nothing else.~
@2407=~We were getting rather desperate. But desperation is a good motivator. I was more resolved then than ever to complete our mission.~
@2408=~He was a professional. I suspect in his older age, he was also looking for a noble end as much as anything. Maybe it seemed like a good way to die.~
@2409=~We found the scion in one of the jail cells. He was beaten and ragged, but alive. Our burglar picked the lock as I began to weave the spells that would prepare our trip back.~
@2410=~However, just as we had unchained our target, the burglar attempted to shove his dagger into my neck. A defensive spell that I had cast discretely beforehand caused the attack to bounce harmlessly away, saving my life.~
@2411=~It seems that betrayal had been planted into our group from the start. The scion's father could not afford more than six bands all along, and decided the best chance of getting his son back was to hire six adventures, but to ensure that one of our bands would go to his son, leaving one of us dead or stranded behind. The burglar was the only one filled in on that detail, and tasked to ensure it for a sizable bonus.~
@2412=~I fought off the burglar with the last of my spells. But I was exhausted, my magic had reached its limit, and I was out of arrows, while his blade was still sharp. Just as I thought myself doomed, the blunt side of an obsidian axe slammed into the burglar, sending him back into the same cage we'd just pulled the scion from. Our barbarian had returned, bloodied yet still standing. We tore the band off his wrist and shut the bars while he tried to recover his breath.~
@2413=~How dramatic!~
@2414=~A fitting end for such betrayal.~
@2415=~Is this story over yet?~
@2416=~We escaped just as the Mercykillers came down into the cells, teleporting out of that cursed place but leaving our little burglar behind. Only two of us returned with the Scion in tow, yet the cost was great.~
@2417=~I made sure to take an extra share of reward for the Duke's deceit. I hear that the barbarian took an ear as well. All in all, a memorable if fraught adventure, wouldn't you say?~
@2418=~Incredible. Would you mind if I made that story a part of my compositions?~
@2419=~Quite the adventure! Few could say that they've had anything like it.~
@2420=~It seems too far-fetched to be believed, but an interesting tale nonetheless.~
@2421=~At least this barbarian made it out as well. Do you know what happened to him after?~
@2422=~If nothing else, you've given me plenty of reason to stay out of the lower planes.~
@2423=~*sigh* If you must. Just don't put it to verse. Or if you do, only sing it far from my ears.~
@2424=~I hope it entertained you, but more importantly that you learned something from it. Never take such stories for pure fancy. There's always something to be learned in them.~
@2425=~If only it was so simple. If you continue as you have been, a jaunt there may be inevitable. I doubt you'll need to keep this story to compel you to leave as soon as your business is finished.~
@2426=~I heard that he went back up north with his reward to his tribe. The adventuring life never really suited him. I imagine with the amount of coin he earned, he could live comfortably the rest of his life. Perhaps a lesson to us all.~
@2427=~Hmm. I want to turn things back to you. It's curious, you've advanced so much in a short time. How long has it been since you started adventuring?~
@2428=~Only a month, if you can believe it.~
@2429=~A bit over a month now.~
@2430=~Near a season, by my counting.~
@2431=~It's been a bit over season.~
@2432=~Almost half a year now.~
@2433=~A bit over half a year.~
@2434=~Almost a year.~
@2435=~Uh, it's been a while. Over a year now...~
@2436=~I don't even keep track. It feels like I started a lifetime ago.~
@2437=~The days sort of blur together. It honestly seems like it's all happened in an instant.~
@2438=~Only a month? Incredible. I've never seen someone accomplish so much, starting from a position so little, in such a short amount of time. It's no wonder the Iron Throne seems so unable to respond to you.~
@2439=~Only so long? Your advancement in that time is truly commendable. I would not want to be in the Iron Throne with an enemy like you after them.~
@2440=~A reasonable amount of time, given your accomplishments and how much you've traveled. The Iron Throne has a dangerous enemy in you.~
@2441=~A bit of time then. You could stand to move a bit faster against the Iron Throne, though they certainly seem content to sit and wait for you to interfere with their plans.~
@2442=~Has it really been that long? Gods, I've been stuck on this coast forever. You could stand to take a few less naps. The Iron Throne must be getting bored waiting for you.~
@2443=~That's understandable. Such sudden and profound changes mark a shift in how we even perceive our lives.~
@2444=~But my point is that you've now become accustomed to this adventuring life, in whatever sense you can. I have a question for you.~
@2445=~Sure, what do you want to know?~
@2446=~Sure, what do you want to know?~
@2447=~I am wondering if you'd like-~
@2448=~Imoen. I see you will be... joining us?~
@2449=~Anyway, my question was, after all this time experiencing the highs and lows of what this adventuring life offers you, do you see another life for yourself beyond it? Or is this it to you?~ 
@2450=~Gee, keepin' the questions light and fluffy tonight, huh?~
@2451=~Who would want anything more than this? Adventuring provides endless excitement and discovery. Every day is a new horizon. I’ll gladly do it until the day I die.~
@2452=~It’s hard to describe, but something in my blood feels drawn to all this. Despite the danger and hardships, I can’t imagine doing anything else.~
@2453=~Adventuring affords me an opportunity to do good and help others in a way no other life could ever hope to match. I don’t see myself stopping that quest.~
@2454=~It suits me now, but I think I’ll cut out while I’m ahead. What’s the point of all this gold and prestige if it isn’t used to stop and enjoy it in my twilight years?~
@2455=~I think I’d actually quite like to find love and settle down. Adventuring has its perks, but I think it’d be no substitute for raising a family.~
@2456=~I hope not. Adventuring is such a pain. It's full of boring travel, uncomfortable sleep, terrible food, and pointless danger. The second I’m afforded a chance at another life, I’m taking it.~
@2457=~If you find another profession filled with more death and violence than this, I’m all ears. Until then, adventuring gives me excuse enough to indulge those base urges to kill or be killed that keep me feeling alive.~
@2458=~It’s hard to see anything else, but this isn’t the kind of life one grows old and dies happily doing. I hope I can find something else, eventually.~
@2459=~No, that wasn’t quite what we were talking about. I was about to ask <CHARNAME> a question, though I would not mind hearing your perspective too.~
@2460=~Oh, ya wanna hear what I got ta say too? Illasera, I’m hurt ya only have been sneakin’ <CHARNAME> off for drinks and chat and never bothered ta ask me too. Maybe I feel like a third wheel now.~
@2461=~Yes, this attitude is generally why I didn't invite you. But, if you're interested now, let me remedy this offense.~ 
@2462=~Aw sure thing. Gotta make sure you're treatin' <CHARNAME> right anyhow.~
@2463=~I thought that might be the case. For some of us, there's something undeniably alluring about it all. We couldn't give it up if we tried.~
@2464=~Oh, I could.~
@2465=~You have a different perspective, I take it?~
@2466=~Yeah. I mean, it's fun and all. But all the violence, all the... all the death. I could do without that.~
@2467=~And yet you stay with <CHARNAME>. You indulge in the violence and death all the same.~
@2468=~It's not... it's not like that. I'm here because I want ta help <CHARNAME>. I'm here ta protect <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@2469=~Your voice quivers. Does this life disgust you? Or does it touch something inside of you that you are afraid of?~
@2470=~Disgust, fear, whatever you want to call it. I just don't like it. But I'm stickin' with <CHARNAME>, as long as it takes.~
@2471=~After that, wouldn't mind settlin' down and enjoyin' long a rest. Gods know we deserved one.~
@2472=~We still have a ways to go before then, Imoen.~
@2473=~Why don't we close out tonight with a toast? To the adventuring life.~
@2474=~The point of life isn't the destination. It's what fulfills you in the moment. I just can't imagine being fulfilled by anything else. And I think we're more similar in that way than you realize.~
@2475=~Gonna agree with <CHARNAME> on this one.~
@2476=~I find that hardly surprising. I thought you enjoyed all this.~
@2477=~Yeah. I mean, it's fun and all. But all the violence, all the... all the death. I could do without that.~
@2478=~May our actions shake Faerun itself. We are destined for greater things. Thank you for this chat, <CHARNAME>. I must get to work on our final attack on Cherise, but I will contact you when I am ready.~
@2479=~You’ve put a lot of thought into this, clearly.~
@2480=~If you’re asking me if I fantasize about romantic prospects, the answer is quite definitively “No”. I have little interest in burdening myself with another’s care.~
@2481=~Oh don't think yourself so keen. I have my urges, if you really care to know. When I feel those needs, I find the least objectionable person nearby and take care of them. There’s no need for ‘romance’ in the equation.~
@2482=~I’ve heard very few complaints. Do not think me some cow that just lays there. I’m a professional. If I choose to do something, I won’t settle for doing so less than exceptionally. I just prefer to keep my relationships transactional. Things are easier that way.~
@2483=~You two are really quite close together, aren't you?~

// Illasera Act 3 Quests Blocks

@2484=~<CHARNAME>, is it gauche to congratulate myself on my own timing? Though I doubt you needed my assistance with this garbage. Go ahead and strip these clowns of their belongings and meet me in the room back this way. Last one on the right. We need to speak.~
@2485=~<CHARNAME>, I hope you’ll excuse the location. In terms of whorehouses, this one rates rather poorly.~
@2486=~It seems your trip to Candlekeep was a success.~
@2487=~You have a strange definition of success.~
@2488=~What do you mean? It was a complete disaster!~
@2489=~I did kick the hornet’s nest, didn’t I?~
@2490=~The Iron Throne’s leadership is dead and you’ve forced your true enemy to act while you live to stop him. I would say things have gone as well as they could have, given the circumstances. Let’s be honest, you hadn't been conducting your business with terribly much subtlety before, so this is rather 'on brand' for you.~ 
@2491=~For once, I am not entirely in disagreement with Illasera. We may have been caught in a trap, but we've emerged better informed and equipped than ever before.~
@2492=~This just doesn’t feel like success.~
@2493=~I suppose you have a point.~
@2494=~Hey, I’m plenty subtle...~
@2495=~How much do you know about Sarevok?~
@2496=~It’s certainly not victory, at least not yet, but you’re closer than ever before to it. And defeat as well, if you mess it up now.~
@2497=~At every step closer to success, the probability of failure grows. Doom has never been closer.~
@2498=~I feel like I should tell you... in Candlekeep, I learned I am a child of the dead god Bhaal.~
@2499=~Thank you for the help against those assassins.~
@2500=~I assume you sought me about because of Cherise?~
@2501=~*snort* History would indicate quite otherwise.~
@2502=~I know that he is a godchild of Bhaal. I know that he has used the Iron Throne to his own ends and is the mastermind behind the iron crisis. I know that he has surrounded himself with sycophants who look to use his ambition to rise to their own power, including our dear Cherise. And I know he seeks power through some insane plot that ties to his godly blood. Is there something I am missing?~
@2503=~Just that I am his half <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>. I found a note in Candlekeep that revealed it to me.~
@2504=~How *do* you know all of this, exactly? I’m only just finding out, but it sounds like none of this is new information to you.~
@2505=~No, that just about covers it. I assume you sought me out because of Cherise?~
@2506=~Interesting.~
@2507=~’Interesting’? That’s it? How is this not more of a surprise to you?~
@2508=~Not even phased by that, are you?~
@2509=~Think nothing of it. You would have handled the matter effortlessly without me, I am sure.~
@2510=~I've said before, I'm very well informed. Some of it came from rumors and details spread among my contacts. Others I pieced together from following and watching you.~
@2511=~You mean you always knew? This is information I would have appreciated beforehand.~
@2512=~Well, I should mention that I am his <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>. I found a note in Candlekeep that revealed it to me.~
@2513=~I could not share it with you. The details of my contacts and what they know are confidential. Now that you know, there's no use trying to hide it.~
@2514=~I do not withhold these details from you out of malice. Trust me, if there's anything I know of that I think will help you, I will be forthcoming. Otherwise, I must use discretion.~
@2515=~It would seem to be obvious in retrospect. Why else would he take a personal interest in killing some unknown young <PRO_MANWOMAN> from a secluded monastery with no connections to the Sword Coast than that he sees you as a threat to his inheritance?~
@2516=~I know that he is a godchild of Bhaal. I know that he has used the Iron Throne to his own ends and is the mastermind behind the iron crisis. I know that he has surrounded himself with sycophants who look to use his ambition to rise to their own power, including our dear Cherise. And I know he seeks power through some insane plot that ties to his godly blood. Is there something I am missing?~
@2517=~How *do* you know all of this, exactly? I’m only just finding out, but it sounds like none of this is new information to you.~
@2518=~No, that just about covers it. I assume you sought me out because of Cherise?~
@2519=~I've said before, I'm very well informed. Some of it came from rumors and details spread among my contacts. Others I pieced together from following and watching you.~
@2520=~I could not share it with you. The details of my contacts and what they know are confidential. Now that you know, there's no use trying to hide it.~
@2521=~I do not withhold these details from you out of malice. Trust me, if there's anything I know of that I think will help you, I will be forthcoming. Otherwise, I must use discretion.~
@2522=~’You see’? That’s it? How is this not more of a surprise to you?~
@2523=~It would seem to be obvious in retrospect. Why else would he take a personal interest in killing some unknown young <PRO_MANWOMAN> from a secluded monastery with no connections to the Sword Coast than that he sees you as a threat to his inheritance?~
@2524=~Yes. With Sarevok’s endgame kicked into motion, it leaves us with remarkably little time to act. I have been researching Cherise’s demesne and I believe I can use the crystal you recovered from their sanctum to send you and your team in to attack her.~
@2525=~What about you? Will you be joining me?~
@2526=~We don’t have time for this. Sarevok’s making a move against the Dukes and I have to stop him.~
@2527=~Excellent. I’m looking forward to giving her a well deserved kick in the arse!~
@2528=~After my previous intrusion, she warded the plane against me specifically. I had hoped to undo these protections before I met you again, but there is no longer time. You will have to go in without me.~
@2529=~I don’t love the idea of going into that place without your assistance, but I guess we have no choice.~
@2530=~Once again I’m being sent off to do your dirty work then? Figures.~
@2531=~At the coronation ceremony, yes? Time is short, I agree, but the ceremony isn’t for a while longer yet. Make no mistake, this is the only opportunity we have to take care of this Red Wizard witch before she can reconnect with Sarevok. You do not want to confront him while he commands her magics.~
@2532=~I suppose that’s a fair point. I have a bit of time left.~
@2533=~I don’t want to take that risk. The Dukes are my greatest priority right now. I will assist you in this after I’ve ensured their safety.~
@2534=~When you give me the word, I will conduct the ritual to teleport you into her astral demesne. I warn you however that you must go in prepared. I will not be able to pull you out so long as Cherise lives to maintain her wards. Once she falls, her wards should unravale, and I can pull you back to the material plane.~
@2535=~What’s it like in there?~
@2536=~What kind of resistance should I expect? Anything specific I should prepare?~
@2537=~I am as ready as I’ll ever be. Send me in.~
@2538=~Give me more time to prepare. I’ll return when I am ready.~
@2539=~Hmph, if you believe that is more pressing. But do not confront Sarevok directly without taking care of this first. He has allies enough without adding as powerful a mage as Cherise to them.~
@2540=~Twisted rock pathways suspended within a void, where elements of astral space have been shaped into figments of reality among those unreal pathways. The Red Wizards housed their menagerie on scattered rocks that are connected by portal archways found throughout. Cherise herself will likely be within a citadel at the far edge of the plane. It has the look of some type of astral crossroad, likely built long long ago before Cherise and her Red Wizards found it.~
@2541=~Her menagerie, run amok. From my own assault there, there were a number of trolls, golems, frost salamanders, and fire elementals there. She has a small handful of acolytes remaining, attempting to corral the creatures. Expect some surprises as well, I was not able to scout that realm in full and I expect she has a few stronger creatures still at her command.~
@2542=~From what I saw, make sure that you have weapons or spells of fire or acid for the trolls. If you bring fire, that will no doubt assist against the salamanders as well. The golems I saw were of clay and stone. Only blunt weapons will harm the clay ones. Don’t bother using your spells against them, golems are completely immune to magic.~
@2543=~Within the Astral Realm, Cherise will be hiding in her Citadel. She likely has it warded against entry, so search for any scattered acolytes that might remain for ways to get in. Good luck in there, <CHARNAME>.~
@2544=~You returned. Are you prepared to venture beyond the Material Realm and face Cherise? Again, I implore you to prepare as best you can. This will not be a trivial endeavor.~
@2545=~Deliciously done, <CHARNAME>. Cherise is dead, and Sarevok is isolated of yet another ally.~
@2546=~You sure came quickly.~
@2547=~You sound disappointed. Wish I'd left some for you?~
@2548=~She may have been a powerful mage, but she died like a common goblin all the same.~
@2549=~I had been working to undo the wards that locked me out when all at once they dissolved away. I saw no reason to delay. Why? Would you prefer if I baked a pie before I chased you here?~
@2550=~I miss pies. The ones that old Nammy the housemaid could make were just so good and I... ah, sorry, I'll shut up now.~
@2551=~Point taken. As you can see, the situation here is handled.~
@2552=~You do something so domestic? I couldn't imagine it.~
@2553=~Oh, a slice of peach pie would be divine actually.~
@2554=~You know me so well. Are there any greater pleasures in life than throwing down an arrogant Thayan? I'd have so relished to see the look in her eyes when she realized she was about to die.~
@2555=~Hmph! (She speaks as if I am not here at all. She will regret it, oh she will regret it...)~
@2556=~You are a ruthless bitch, Illasera.~
@2557=~I take no pleasure in ending any life, even one as foul as hers.~
@2558=~Ha! Yeah, you should have seen her. She was like, 'Oh no, not my spleen! BLECH!'~
@2559=~They all do. But I hope that you were able to extract some pleasure from this experience. You bested a powerful enemy today. Don't tell me that you didn't feel a thrill of exhilaration in it.~
@2560=~We must not let our fervor for smiting evil grow into bloodlust. It is enough to feel the gratification of knowing that judgment was delivered today.~
@2561=~I did what I had to do. I take no pleasure in it.~
@2562=~I mostly just feel relief that it's over.~
@2563=~I enjoyed testing my prowess against hers. Her death is just a consequence of that.~
@2564=~I never said that. Killing her was very enjoyable.~
@2565=~Indeed it is. Do give yourself pause enough to regroup, perhaps give a brief celebration to this victory and its spoils. But true rest will only come once you've confronted Sarevok.~
@2566=~I really *really* deserve a vacation.~
@2567=~So what's the plan now that we've eliminated Cherise?~
@2568=~How hard could it possibly be if every elderly crone has their own 'family recipe'? I'd surely be a master at it if I was a more boring person.~
@2569=~That's a shame. I really could have gone for some rhubarb pie.~
@2570=~You're right. Best not to. So what's the plan now that we've eliminated Cherise?~
@2571=~Ugh, cease this train of thought immediately. I'll not indulge it a second longer.~
@2572=~Fiiiine. So what's the plan now that we've eliminated Cherise?~
@2573=~I'm glad you understand me.~
@2574=~Then your life must be truly a joyless one. I understand you did not choose this life, but you can choose to make it a bit less miserable, no?~
@2575=~I didn't think you'd be one to give me a pep talk.~
@2576=~And join you in your heartless perspective? I'd rather not.~
@2577=~You paint such a compelling picture of it! My disappointment is now vast and immeasurable as the planes. Ah, but it is good to see you are finding some enjoyment in the position you have been placed.~
@2578=~The feeling is warranted. But it's not over yet. You still have a hateful brother who will never stop hunting you.~
@2579=~Professional, I can respect that. There's no greater expression of skill than when one's life is measured against another.~
@2580=~And you do it so very well. But then, you were *born* to take such pleasures in it.~
@2581=~I do not disagree with you. After all you have done, once you destroy Sarevok, I hope you will treat yourself.~
@2582=~Now? You must head back to the Material Plane and prepare for your ultimate confrontation with Sarevok. You've whittled down his allies as best you can, but if he can gain the support of Baldur's Gate, it'll all be for naught. The time for being the rabbit is done. Become the wolf you were born to be.~
@2583=~And what about you? What will you be doing?~
@2584=~Damn right. Now, I hunt.~
@2585=~You're right, what was I thinking? Forget that I said anything. Live however you want, it's of no consequence to me.~
@2586=~<CHARNAME>, I'm hurt. And here I thought by now we'd have come to a non-judgmental understanding with each other.~
@2587=~Now is where we part ways, I think. I wish to examine this realm further, see if there are any secrets still to discover. Know that I wish you the best, however. I doubt you need my wishes, though. You were born for this.~
@2588=~Do you wish for me to send you back to the Material plane now? Make sure you've taken your just rewards from Cherise and her lackies first. If not, I'll just be helping myself. If your allies have anything to share with me before you leave, now is the time.~
@2589=~I'm ready to go. Send us back now.~
@2590=~Give me a moment. I think we might have missed something.~
@2591=~Go and confront Sarevok, foil whatever schemes he has planned. I wish you skill and cunning, young wolf. It has been an unexpected pleasure to work with you.~
@2592=~Pick the bodies clean and return to me so I may send you home.~
@2593=~Are you finished yet? Shall I send you back to the material plane?~
@2594=~<CHARNAME>, we meet yet again. Isn't it such a small world for us to bump into one another yet again?~
@2595=~Such a small world, it's crazy. Heh, I'm glad ta see ya here at the end, Illy.~
@2596=~Ah, as I am with you, Imoen.~
@2597=~Illasera? What are you doing here?~
@2598=~Ha! I knew you'd show up to help at the end!~
@2599=~You know, I'm not even surprised anymore.~
@2600=~So, Sarevok was always your endgame, wasn't he?~
@2601=~Helping you, of course. You didn't think I could let you have all the fun now, do you? Oh, but I can see by that look in your eye that the old song and dance is getting rather dull for you, isn't it?~
@2602=~Oh, then I've truly started to become predictable then, haven't I? I wasn't about to let you have all the fun. Mmm, but I can see by that look in your eye that the old song and dance is getting rather dull for you, isn't it?~
@2603=~You've seen to the heart of the matter. You really are starting to impress me, you know.~
@2604=~Sarevok has always been my goal here, since I arrived on the Sword Coast. He and a man named Winski Perorate, who served as his mentor. I've had a number of contracts, but they were my primary targets.~
@2605=~He's been a challenging target, to say the least. Always surrounded by his allies, never without hidden defenses that would allow even a skilled assassin to strike. I had begun to think the man never slept.~
@2606=~But you revealed him. Stripped him of his defenses and forced him into this corner. I hope you can forgive me for maintaining the facade all this time.~
@2607=~He's gathered a few of his last allies at his side. But with me here, we can even the score. Let me join you, and together we can finish Sarevok and end this.~
@2608=~(Accepting Illasera's Aid will not take up a party slot)~
@2609=~Very well, I accept your aid.~
@2610=~Ha! Finally tired of sitting on the sidelines? I've been waiting to see you in action.~
@2611=~No, this is my fight. Let me do this alone.~
@2612=~Excellent. <CHARNAME>, we may not always have seen eye to eye on matters, but you've shown yourself to be competent and reliable ally. Know that I respect you. And that is not an accolade that I give lightly. I follow your lead.~
@2613=~I agree, it has taken too long to get here. <CHARNAME>, we may not always have seen eye to eye, but just know that you've proven yourself to be an unusually pleasant... mmm colleague? Associate?~ 
@2614=~A friend, maybe?~
@2615=~Come on now, no need to single out a word to define it. You look ridiculous racking your brain over it.~
@2616=~Oh of all the obstinate, idiotic, witless...~
@2617=~Fine. Have your fight. If you die here, I'll go ahead and finish the job myself. But I'll happily let you take the first crack at it. Goodbye, <CHARNAME>.~
@2618=~Oh that sounds so sickly sentimental. But fine... if you'd like to call it that, I won't stop you. Now lets kill this bastard before I get sick.~
@2619=~Of course, how embarrassing for me. Now let us kill a Bhaalspawn.~

// Illasera general Act 2 dialogue block

@2620=~Hello <CHARNAME>. What can I assist you with?~
@2621=~I spoke with the proprietor of the magic store. He told us that the magic was a darker form of druid magic. He suggested I should begin in Cloakwood.~
@2622=~I spoke with the Archdruid of the Shadow Druids. It's not them. Instead, he claimed it to be the work of a Harper named Riezen Darkeyes. He was insistent however that he did not know where this Riezen is, only that he was no longer in Cloakwood.~
@2623=~I spoke with the Dryads of Peldvale. They seemed to indicate that the spell may have originated from a man named Riezen Darkeyes, a Harper. They could not trace the exact location of the man though.~
@2624=~What do you know about the Iron Throne?~
@2625=~What can you tell me about the Red Wizards?~
@2626=~Illasera, I'm a bit confused why you are helping me.~
@2627=~Listen, not that I don't appreciate that you're helping me out with this one, but I have to ask...~
@2628=~Nothing now.~
@2629=~Now, was there anything else?~
@2630=~Why, would you like me to stop? <CHARNAME>, to put it simply, my interests align with yours moreso than you might think. If you don't trust me because I'm not fully transparent with you, then I don't know what to say. No one will ever be fully transparent with you. Most people aren't fully transparent with themselves. I have my own mission and clients to keep in mind, and those require secrecy. So you will have to accept my help for what it is, or walk away. It is your choice.~
@2631=~Why am I helping you? Understand that I have some need for secrecy in what I do. But I can tell you this. I have targets behind the Iron Throne myself, targets well concealed by shadow and secrecy. It is through your activities in the area that I hope to scare them from hiding. Then, I will strike. Until then, I continue to make my own preparations while assisting you in tearing that corrupted organization down.~
@2632=~It’s an interesting organization. They were founded in the Eastern Heartlands, with a heavy presence in Sembia where I am from. They rose to prominence mostly through the trade of arms. While they present a front of being a legitimate mercantile group, they’ve been accused of ruthless and non-competitive business practices. They also have their fingers in some very shady corners of the criminal underground. They were recently barred from doing business in Cormyr.~
@2633=~The decision to expand to the Sword Coast is the pet project of Reiltar Anchev. He is a shrewd businessman with a rather murky background. I understand he may have assumed other identities in the past, or “Reiltar” itself may be yet another facade. By all reports, he has a cordial front facing personality, but behind closed doors is a heartless man. He arrived in Baldur’s Gate with a son, I believe, who helps operate the day to day of the business with him.~
@2634=~The Red Wizards are the ruling class of the magocracy of Thay, a country to the far east that is roundly reviled by every other nation on the continent. Thay has never been satisfied with their own dry plateau, so attempt to expand their influence throughout Faerun through coercion, conspiracy, and invasion.~
@2635=~Individually, they’re haughty, ambitious, and unpleasant. They’re unfortunately by and large also very good spellcasters. So make sure to prepare your magical defenses if you expect to engage them.~

// Illasera Projected Image

@2636=~<CHARNAME>, welcome to Baldur's Gate. I hope you had a pleasant journey north.~
@2637=~Oh hey, it's Illasera, but uh, shiny. Shiny Illasera. How goes it?~
@2638=~Imoen, pink as always. I am well enough. It is... "nice" that <CHARNAME> has kept you around this long.~
@2639=~A projected image? Clever. That is not an easy spell to master.~
@2640=~What's this? Are you here or...?~
@2641=~I would have come to the gates to greet you personally, but I'm entertaining a glass of wine and a guest right now. If you have the time, I'd like you to come and meet him. I believe he may have some information you would find valuable. You can find me at the Elfsong tavern, in this district.~
@2642=~I understand you may have some important business in the city, but you should come quickly. I cannot guarantee they will be able to remain with me much longer. Besides that, my wine glass is nearly empty.~
@2643=~I am no novice mage. I would have come to the gates to greet you personally, but I'm entertaining a glass of wine and a guest right now. If you have the time, I'd like you to come and meet him. I believe he may have some information you would find valuable. You can find me at the Elfsong tavern, in this district.~
@2644=~I understand you may have some important business in the city, but you should come quickly. I cannot guarantee they will be able to remain with me much longer. Besides that, my wine glass is nearly empty.~
@2645=~<CHARNAME>, I found something.~
@2646=~Nerys, I assume? Were you able to find out where Riezen is hiding?~
@2647=~Nerys, this is Illasera. Sort of. Nerys informed us there was an old gorge Harpers used to use as a hideout somewhere outside the city. We're not sure where it is though.~
@2648=~Lucky for you then, I know exactly where the gorge in question is. Come back to the Elfsong Tavern. I can show you the location and fill you in on some things I've learned about this Red Wizard plot.~ 
@2649=~We don't have time for this. Fine, just get here quickly.~

// Interjection File

@2650=~Yes, I believe so. No demon can withstand the holy rites. Once it has been revealed, we can smite it with the full force of Helm's judgment.~
@2651=~Begin your exorcism. We will destroy the demon as it is pulled out of her.~
@2652=~Wait hold on there. We're going to have to fight a *demon*? Oh no no, I think it would be safer to just kill her.~
@2653=~Of course! Tempus will give me the power to force the demon from this little woman so we might smite it from this mortal realm! Prepare yourself for battle, give me the word and I will begin.~
@2654=~Begin your exorcism. We will destroy the demon as it is pulled out of her.~
@2655=~Wait hold on there. We're going to have to fight a *demon*? Oh no no, I think it would be safer to just kill her.~
@2656=~Of course. Any Thayan of merit knows well the Liberus Optimae Erositica. It is the premier guide on the carnal arts, written by masters throughout the ages. In it, a shrewd scholar will learn all that is necessary to leave one's lover breathless in the bedchamber.~
@2657=~That sounds quite impressive, actually. So I guess that explains why this Gentleman fellow would be so interested in it.~
@2658=~It sounds like you know this tome better than just from rumor, eh Edwin?~
@2659=~Indeed I have. We have many recreations of the original tome in Thay. I have studied its teachings well. (They should not be so surprised, Edwin Odesseiron is more than a master in just the arcane arts.)~
@2660=~I guess that explains why this Gentleman fellow would be so interested in it.~
@2661=~I do not, but it is to be expected, as this one looks to be a young initiate. You there, I am Edwin Odesseiron. Identify yourself.~
@2662=~Ah, best not. I believe I recognize her as one who ah, rebuffed my advances quite violently some years past. There were comments made about her disemboweling me should she ever catch sight of me outside sight of our superiors. In fact... I believe I will simply stand aside for now.~ 
@2663=~Days before you came to Cloakwood, a druid came to us seeking the assistance of our circle. Our circle leader cast him out. His harnessing of nature was a defilement, and we knew his past ties would only lead us to destruction.~
@2664=~His name was Riezen Darkeyes, and he was a Harper! To think he could trick us into working with him. He was lucky that we did not chase him as wolves in the night out of Cloakwood.~
@2665=~What? I don't know whatcha talkin' about! Honest. Never heard of it in my life!~
@2666=~C'mon Imoen. Why do you look so red in the cheeks? What's up with the book?~
@2667=~Ugh. Fine. It's uh, this detailed tome of, you know, uh 'intimate information'? Positions and uh... instructions. Also lotsa really detailed drawings. Really detailed. Some of the diagrams even magically animate.~
@2668=~I see. So I guess that explains why this Gentleman fellow would be so interested in it.~
@2669=~Imoen... why do you know so much about this book?~
@2670=~Don't look at me like that! I snuck off inta the keep a few times ta look at it, so what? It was practically the only interestin' book in the sealed off section of the library.~
@2671=~I see. So I guess that explains why this Gentleman fellow would be so interested in it.~
@2672=~Just a few times, huh?~
@2673=~<CHARNAME>, c'mon. I'm never gonna hear the end of this from you, am I? Well, don't expect any mercy from me next time someone asks me embarrassing facts about -you-, ok?~
@2674=~*laugh* Ok ok, I'll drop it. I guess that explains why this Gentleman fellow would be so interested in it.~
@2675=~We talkin' about our favorite adventures? Mine's the one where I snuck inta <CHARNAME>'s pack and stole <PRO_HISHER> undergarments, then dyed them pink and snuck 'em back in before <PRO_HESHE> knew it! Ha!~
@2676=~Never again, do you hear me?~
@2677=~I really don't understand what was so funny about that.~
@2678=~Huh? Oh, I hadn't even noticed.~
@2679=~Well, I thought that the new shade was a lovely color. I'm wearing them now.~
@2680=~That’s not an adventure Imoen...~
@2681=~Pfff! Who would pull the same prank twice? What kinda amateur do you think I am?~
@2682=~What's not funny about it? The great <CHARNAME>, savior of the Sword Coast, wearin' pink underwear. Ha!~
@2683=~I can't tell if you're oblivious or this is just yer latest anti-Imoen technique.~
@2684=~No way! Ha! I'm glad this whole adventuring gig hasn't killed yer sense of humor.~
@2685=~Pfff, sure it is! There was excitement, danger, uncovering of rare loot and artifacts... uh, not that I poked around in yer packs all *that* much, mind you. Uh, right, forget any of that.~ 
@2686=~Yeah, I know. I'm with ya until the end, <CHARNAME>.~
@2687=~OH! Ya won't believe this. While ya were gettin' supplies at that last shop, the old lady who owns the place was tryin' ta set me up with her son! Ya remember him, that dopey lookin' guy stocking the displays?~
@2688=~Really? Him? I hope you let her down gently.~
@2689=~I remember him. He didn’t seem unattractive. Maybe he has some good inner qualities as well.~
@2690=~You should have taken her up on it! Could have been fun.~
@2691=~Not like you could do better.~
@2692=~Yeah, she looked too sweet ta be all mean about it. I'm sure there's someone out there for that dope. Just, definitely not me. Imagine, Imoen settlin' down with a random shopkeeper guy. Ha! As if.~
@2693=~Now you’re just makin’ me feel all superficial. It’s not that, I’m sure he’s a perfectly nice guy. Just not what I’m lookin’ for. I wanna find someone who’s fun and adventurous! Imagine, Imoen settlin' down with a random shopkeeper guy. Ha! As if.~
@2694=~Pff, nah I might like a good prank now n' then, but goin' out with a guy just as a joke is just mean. Nothin' funny about that. Imagine, Imoen settlin' down with a random shopkeeper guy. Ha! As if.~
@2695=~What's got yer pantaloons twisted? I’m sure he’s a perfectly nice guy. Just not what I’m lookin’ for. I wanna find someone who’s fun and adventurous. Imagine, Imoen settlin' down with a random shopkeeper guy. Ha! As if.~
@2696=~No, the one for me is gonna be an elegant courtly mage, sensitive and carin', but with a sharp sense of humor. They’ll laugh at all my jokes and I’ll learn about magic from 'em. We’ll wear the most extravagant and colorful dresses for the royal ball but then hang out in the kitchen and garden, enjoyin’ the company of the small folk. Way more interesting than carousin' with stuffy nobles. We’ll travel all across the Realms, making our own adventures as we go... *wistful sigh*~
@2697=~Well sure, I guess I have. Nothin’ wrong with a little fantasy and romance. What about you? C'mon Illasera, you're not all ice water are ya?~
@2698=~Really? Ya don’t have any room for even a little bit of love in ya life? No one ta share the road with? Sounds like a miserable and lonely way ta be.~
@2699=~What about more uh, brief romantic encounters? I’ve seen ya eye a few people in the tavern while we’ve been passing through. Not that I've been payin' especially close attention to ya or nothin'.~
@2700=~Ya sound like such a generous lover.~
@2701=~Ok fine, I get it. What about you, <CHARNAME>? How are things going when it comes loooooove!~
@2702=~I’d actually rather not talk about that.~
@2703=~I’m not really interested in that thing.~
@2704=~I'm with Illasera, there's no point to romance.~
@2705=~As much as I'd like to, I feel like I haven't really been afforded the time.~
@2706=~A few dalliances here and there, nothing serious.~
@2707=~There is someone special... but that will be my little secret.~
@2708=~Well, I think there might be something developing with Neera. It's early but promising.~
@2709=~Things are going well between Neera and I.~
@2710=~Well, I think there might be something developing with Rasaad. It's early but promising.~
@2711=~Things are going well between Rasaad and I.~
@2712=~Well, I think there might be something developing with Dorn. It's early but promising.~
@2713=~Things are going well between Dorn and I.~
@2714=~Well, I think there might be something developing with Ajantis. It's early but promising.~
@2715=~Things are going well between Ajantis and I.~
@2716=~Well, I think there might be something developing with Xan. It's early but promising.~
@2717=~Things are going well between Xan and I.~
@2718=~Well, I think there might be something developing with Dynaheir. It's early but promising.~
@2719=~Things are going well between Dynaheir and I.~
@2720=~Well, I think there might be something developing with Coran. It's early but promising.~
@2721=~Things are going well between Coran and I.~
@2722=~Well, I think there might be something developing with Branwen. It's early but promising.~
@2723=~Things are going well between Branwen and I.~
@2724=~Well, I think there might be something developing with Shar-Teel. It's early but promising.~
@2725=~Things are going well between Shar-Teel and I.~
@2726=~Oh c'moooon. Who am I supposed ta live through vicariously if not for you? Or are you just afraid I'll tease you?~
@2727=~*sigh* I suppose ya interests always did tend ta be elsewhere. That's ok. More for me. You'll just have ta watch as I assemble a harem of the hotties you pass by!~
@2728=~Tell me about it, *sigh*. This is why we gotta stop and take a break soon! There's gotta be dozens of chances at love just slippin' through our fingers!~
@2729=~Ha! I knew it! I'm so gonna ask for details when we set up camp. Don't try to avoid me, I need to live vicariously through -someone- here.~
@2730=~Aww! See, now this is the kinda high quality gossip I can't wait ta share with the others. Kiddin'! It'll be our secret.~
@2731=~I'm glad ta hear it. If anyone needs to find a little solace on the road, it's you. I'm sure you two make each other real happy.~
@2732=~Sure are! We’ve gone through a lot. And that was before we left Candlekeep. Remember the time we slipped a potion of invisibility ta one of Dreppin's cows...~
@2733=~This magic is druidic in nature, yet darker... emphasizing its violent aspects and not its life-bringing ones. I can think that only a Shadow Druid could be behind such a spell.~
@2734=~Do you know who specifically, Jaheira?~
@2735=~No, unfortunately not. I am not well acquainted with Shadow Druids. They are a rival sect and very hostile to other circles who promote ideas of harmony between civilization and nature. I cannot even say for certain they are responsible, but it is what I would look into first.~
@2736=~Less than I wish I could say. It is more accurate only to say that I know of him, that he was a talented druid and skilled spy who was undertaking a secretive mission. However, he ceased contact with the larger Harper organization as his methods became more and more antithetical to what they stood for. It is troubling if he is involved here.~
@2737=~That doesn't bode well.~
@2738=~Wait, Jaheira, how do you know about this?~
@2739=~I know a great many things, <CHARNAME>. Please trust though that the knowledge I have will only be used to help you. But there are some things even I cannot tell you for now. Perhaps some day.~
@2740=~Shar does empower me to exorcise those who have come under an outsider's control. It would force the demon out into a physical form that could be fought. But it would be safer to simply kill the darthirii, and sever the demon's ties to the mortal plane directly. Would you really risk all our lives just for this pitiful girl?~
@2741=~Please do what you can to try. I'd save her if we are able to.~
@2742=~You may be right. Better to kill her than to have to fight a demon.~
@2743=~Aye. It's been a spell since I last tangled with demonkind. Clangeddin's might will force the demon from the girl so we can smite it proper.~
@2744=~Begin your exorcism. We will destroy the demon as it is pulled out of her.~
@2745=~Wait hold on there. We're going to have to fight a *demon*? Oh no no, I think it would be safer to just kill her.~
@2746=~Oh yes, the ogre mage. He came up to the gates a few days back, requesting entry into our library. Can you believe it? An ogre-mage in Candlekeep? Preposterous! Could you even imagine such a thing while you were living here?~
@2747=~Right. Well, I actually came here to ask you to reconsider.~
@2748=~I know, ridiculous, right? But I still need to figure out a way to deal with the guy. Do you have any suggestions?~
@2749=~I hope this is only a bad jest. Well spoken he may have been, but I will not allow an ogre mage to have access to some of the most dangerous magical tomes in all the Realms. Not to mention the scare he would cause among the scribes. No, as long as I am the Keeper of the Portal, that creature will not step foot in the Citadel.~
@2750=~He's strangling the road of travelers to Candlekeep and robbing them of the tomes that would go to the library. Don't you have any interest in stopping that?~
@2751=~I genuinely believe him when he says he means no harm. I'm sure he would be more than agreeable to being kept under heavy guard and escort.~
@2752=~Pff, the scribes could use a little scare to liven up their day. Maybe it'll shock the stick out of their arses.~
@2753=~The edicts that restrict entry into Candlekeep do not specify that Ogre Mages cannot have entry. If he has a tome to offer, why not just let him in?~
@2754=~I've spoken to him at length and it seems he only wants a single tome. The Liberus Optimae Erositica. Do you know of any scribes who have visited who might be in the area with a copy?~ 
@2755=~I suppose there's not much more to say. I'll figure out some other way to take care of the ogre mage.~
@2756=~I see little reason to not simply give him a thrashing that sends him back to wherever he came from. You look capable enough, and I know Gorion taught you well. Have at him!~
@2757=~Just the same, I'd like to see if I can resolve this nonviolently.~
@2758=~Yeah, I suppose there's not really any other way to go about it. Farewell.~
@2759=~The edicts of Candlekeep dictate that we cannot act beyond our walls. Even if it does divert travelers temporarily, the rules are clear. We will just need to trust in the surrounding authorities to intervene.~
@2760=~An Ogre Mage under guard and escort? Would you give me a viper and ask me to lead it by the mouth? I cannot tell if you are trying to get my men killed or are just hopelessly naive. I will not be taken in by a fiend's honeyed words.~
@2761=~You may think yourself funny. I am not amused.~
@2762=~You would argue with a watcher on legal grounding? The edicts give me leeway as needed to ensure that no disruption occurs to our sacred library. That ogre mage is surely such a disruption. There is no discussion to be had of it.~
@2763=~Absolutely not. I don't care if he wants th-~
@2764=~Wait, really? He wants -that- book?~
@2765=~Yeah. Came all the way from Kara-Tur for it. Weird, right?~
@2766=~Not so weird as you might think. That book saved my marriage, heh. I believe old Firebeard Elvenhair is well acquainted with that tome. Oh don't give me that look, he's old now, but he used to be quite the playboy in his day. He is back home in Beregost for the season. Seek him out. Perhaps he can think of a solution.~
@2767=~We're not here about getting in Keeper. I actually want to speak about the ogre who requested entry recently.~
@2768=~Hey mister Elvenhair. Ah, this is going to sound a bit strange but there's this ogre out in front of Candlekeep who is looking for a tome. The uhh, Liberus Optimae Erositica. You don't happen to know where I can get that, do you?~
@2769=~Ah yes, you are in luck. I just so happen to have a written copy of that particular tome with me. You are welcome to have it. It doesn't have the flashy magical moving pictures of the real thing, you'll have to settle for simple drawn diagrams.~
@2770=~Oh, but no need to make up some story about marauding lusty ogres. You're a young <PRO_MANWOMAN> who is surely curious about such things. No need to be ashamed of it. Use this knowledge well! Now off you go.~ 
@2771=~Aye. You must be referring to little Nerys. Used to come here some weeks ago. Had to kick her out, was making my paying clients a bit nervous. Heard she been haunting patrons of the Three Old Kegs up by the palace, if ya looking for her.~
@2772=~Excuse me. We were told you might know something of magic and could tell us something about this spider that attacked us. We're trying to track down who could have cast the spell that created it.~
@2773=~Hmm... I could examine the nature of the spell work, to see if it might contain any clues. But it will cost you! I do not consult for charity work. Two hundred gold for my assistance, and I cannot guarantee you the results will be exactly what you want. Well then, what say you?~
@2774=~That sounds fair. Here you are.~
@2775=~Afraid I'm a bit short right now. I'll come back later.~
@2776=~I think I need to take stock of my finances before I hand over that amount. Maybe I'll return later.~
@2777=~Alright then, hand it over. And the spider too. Let me see here. Ah, disgusting thing. It will take half the sum you gave me just to clean off the table.~
@2778=~Hmm... druidic magic, no doubt. But a shade darker. Something more akin to those rare druids who inhabit the Underdark. Or perhaps based in the Shadow Druid circle. Yes, I see here that this weave contains a specific aspect common to spells practiced by the shadow druids.~
@2779=~I cannot divine the exact caster of the spell. But I can direct you to the Shadow Druids out in Cloakwood, if you can survive the journey. The magic is either of their kind, or they may know more. Off with you now.~
@2780=~Actually, I was wondering if you could help me out with something. I'm looking into an organization of thieves operating in your city. The Night Knives. Do you know about them?~
@2781=~I'm looking into an organization of thieves operating in your city. The Night Knives. Do you know about them?~
@2782=~I have the necklace you're looking for right here.~
@2783=~Now now, I hardly know you and you're already asking about guests on my own grounds? Hardly the right foot to get off on. Perhaps I know something of these "Night Knives". But how do I know I can trust you? Ah, but perhaps if you've had some kind of dealings with our guild, it might improve your standing enough for me to confide in you?~
@2784=~Then perhaps I might interest you in an alternative?~
@2785=~Yes yes, I know of the Night Knives you speak of. They came into the city quite recently, and provided gold upfront with a respectful request to be allowed temporary dealings in the city.~
@2786=~They kidnapped someone and I need to find where they're located.~
@2787=~Could you tell me where they are? I have business with them.~
@2788=~As I said, I gave them right to operate within the city limits with my blessing. The payment they gave for my allowance was significant. Why should I betray my word to them to you?~
@2789=~Seems to me that their operations might just attract more attention to you from the guard. They don't need to know you informed on them. Why not just let me take care of it?~
@2790=~Everything has a price. How much is yours?~
@2791=~Perhaps you'd be interested in a trade? Is there some job I could do in exchange for that information?~
@2792=~Your silver tongue may help you in many areas, but I require more than fancy talk to secure my cooperation.~ 
@2793=~Everything has a price. How much is yours?~
@2794=~Perhaps you'd be interested in a trade? Is there some job I could do in exchange for that information?~
@2795=~Forget it. I'll find them some other way.~
@2796=~The price is three thousand. You hand over the gold, I forget my promise and tell you exactly where it is you can find them.~
@2797=~Three thousand is quite a sum for a location.~
@2798=~I unfortunately cannot afford that sum.~
@2799=~Here, have your gold. Where are they?~
@2800=~Forget it. I'll find them some other way.~
@2801=~It just so happens, I do have a rather sensitive job I need done, one worth quite a bit more to me than the gold those Sembian knaves gave me.~
@2802=~Word is that old Entar Silvershield's wife has gotten a fancy necklace after a trip up to Waterdeep. A Laeral's Tear, but with a unique design. See, the problem is, a dear old friend of mine up that way was outbid by the fair dame, and thinks that she was quite cheated on the matter.~
@2803=~Now, I've been thinking of expanding some of our operations up that way, and having a grateful contact like that could help move mountains. So I'd like you to 'procure' said necklace from Brilla Silvershield and bring it back to me. She wears it on at all times, so you may need a friend with quick fingers to do the job.~
@2804=~Absolutely not. I won't even entertain the thought of it.~
@2805=~I think I'd rather just pay you for the information I want.~
@2806=~I've always enjoyed playing the trade on a snooty noble or two. How do I get started?~
@2807=~Hmph, a sizable sum to be sure. And enough for me to forget whatever dealings were made with the Night Knives in the first place. Just as well, I understood that I would have to make some allowances for them, but kidnappings were never discussed.~
@2808=~You'll find them at the docks, in the southern most warehouse. They occupied it only very recently, so if you'd been there before, you would not have seen them. I assure you however that it is where they are now. Do not mention that I told you this to anyone.~
@2809=~Glad I am to hear it. I hear she doesn't get out from the Silvershield Estate much. Oh, and make sure it is the authentic necklace from Brilla. No other Laerel's Tear will do.~
@2810=~Do be careful. They keep a retinue of guards within the home. I trust in your abilities in the matter.~
@2811=~Yes, yes, I do believe that is the real deal. A fantastic job, <CHARNAME>. Now, if I may, I'll just be taking that necklace of your person. With that job completed, I would be more than happy to illuminate the dealings of our Night Knife friends for you.~
@2812=~Actually, I was wondering if you could help me out with something. I'm looking into an organization of thieves operating in your city. The Night Knives. Do you know about them?~
@2813=~Actually, I was wondering if you could help me out with something. I'm looking into an organization of thieves operating in your city. The Night Knives. Do you know about them?~
@2814=~I was wondering if you could help me out with something. I'm looking into an organization of thieves operating in your city. The Night Knives. Do you know about them?~
@2815=~Actually, I was wondering if you could help me out with something. I'm looking into an organization of thieves operating in your city. The Night Knives. Do you know about them?~
@2816=~I haven't heard anything about such an organization as yet. I'll speak to some of my men to see if they've seen any thieves, outside the usual. In the meantime, I'd urge you to continue you investigation into the Seven Suns.~ 
@2817=~I'm afraid that my men have been so stretched thin about the city, we've had little time to take notice of the activities of thieves and other scoundrels. I am sorry, but I cannot help you at this time.~
@2818=~With your help clearing the trade coasters and exposing the doppelganger threat, my men have been able to cover some more ground in their patrols than usual.~
@2819=~One thing they reported that I haven't been able to investigate yet is a band of cloaked figures who seem to be gathering in one of the warehouses by the docks. You've done good work for the city so far, so if there are any illicit activities happening there, I full authorize you to take care of it.~

// Keldath

@2820=~No, I don't believe anyone of the sort has visited this temple. Although you must forgive me, I'm quite busy and am not able to keep tabs on every traveler who wanders by. Ah, I must remember to visit the vestibule soon. Dawn Priests Blane and Bram have not reported back from their cleaning in quite some time.~
@2821=~I'm looking for some fugitive adventurers who murdered a boy in Beregost. I've heard they might have passed this way. Have you seen them?~

// Krotia dialogue

@2822=~Gods damn it, who are you? Is it too much to hope that the Zulkirs would send assistance to fix this mess? No, I see you are just another intruder into this realm.~
@2823=~I don't have anything to say to Red Wizard scum.~
@2824=~Hold! I request a parley before this comes to blows.~
@2825=~Uh, can we talk about this?~
@2826=~Why do you return? There's nothing left for us to discuss. Go and kill Cherise if you can. I will not interfere.~
@2827=~Why do you return? There's nothing left for us to discuss. You have your mission, go!~
@2828=~Bastards. For the Zulkirs! I fight until my last breath!~
@2829=~No, I don't think we can. I fight until my last breath!~
@2830=~Unexpected, but I will grant it. Who are you stranger, and what are you doing here?~
@2831=~I am <CHARNAME>, an adventurer of the Sword Coast. I am trying to reach Cherise Siltuhr.~
@2832=~I am Rasaesh, agent of the Iron Throne. I was sent here to assist Cherise Siltuhr at the bidding of my master Sarevok.~
@2833=~Edwin, would you take the lead on this one?~
@2834=~<CHARNAME>? Then you are an enemy of mine and are foolish to proclaim yourself outright. Why should I not kill you where you stand?~
@2835=~*sniffs* I smell blood on her. She speaks confidently, but she's hiding an injury.~
@2836=~Now this is what all women should aspire to be. She stands next to death, but doesn't show weakness.~
@2837=~Because you know my reputation and how little chance you stand if this comes to violence.~
@2838=~Because you are alone and in no shape to pick a fight with me. Why not speak instead?~
@2839=~You seem reasonable enough. Why not at least give me a chance to speak my peace? What could I have to say that you should fear?~
@2840=~I’m bored of this already. Prepare to die, Thayan.~
@2841=~You are a poor liar. Enough of this! For the Zulkirs! I fight until my last breath!~
@2842=~As true as that may be, I am sworn to serve the Zulkirs faithfully with no fear of death. To work with a known enemy is treason. I will gladly die fighting our enemies before I let my family line be cursed for all time due to my cowardice.~
@2843=~It is truly a shame when one commits to honorable acts in the name of dishonorable masters.~
@2844=~Humor me. I've introduced myself. Who are you?~
@2845=~Is this that fabled Thayan courtesy I've heard about?~
@2846=~Ok *now* I'm board of this. Prepare to die, Thayan.~
@2847=~Hold your tongue, knave. It is only because of my 'Thayan courtesy' that I have agreed to this undoubtedly worthless exchange of words.~
@2848=~Very well. I am Krotia the Black, enforcer to the will of the Zulkirs. I came here under the charge of Cherise as her guardian. Before you entertain any foolish notions that you can turn me against my task, know that my pledge to the Zulkirs is made through honor and bound in magic. I cannot and will not shirk my mission. What else is there to speak of?~
@2849=~What are you doing here?~
@2850=~What is this place?~
@2851=~Could you tell me about Cherise?~
@2852=~Hold. You say you serve the Zulkirs directly? Not Cherise?~
@2853=~Was there anything else? Or shall we raise our blades against each other now?~
@2854=~Then let it be violence. Prepare to die, Thayan scum.~
@2855=~There’s little use hiding this moment of weakness from you, since it is clear for any savage to see. The efforts of your ally caused my master to release the sealing wards that kept the menagerie under our control. Cherise sent her retinue to regain control of this domain while she worked to re-establish the containments.~
@2856=~A crossroad of some kind, used by mages long ago. Cherise suspects the Netherise, but it hardly seems important now.~
@2857=~What do you hope to learn? Some weakness you can exploit? Some warning of what is yet to come. Or did you simply wish to raise discontent to sow division in our ranks? I’ll give you nothing of the kind. She is a talented mage who commands enough power to earn her a place of respect among Thayan society despite her foreign heritage. You need not know anything else.~
@2858=~I hardly see why that is a pertinent matter. Yes, I swore my pledge to the Zulkirs directly. Yet they have vested their will in Cherise and thus I am sworn to her.~
@2859=~<CHARNAME>, dids't thou keep any evidence from our earlier assault? It wilst surely take proof to convince her.~
@2860=~What if I was to tell you that Cherise’s mission here was not sanctioned by the Zulkirs and that she plans to betray them?~
@2861=~You fool, Cherise doesn’t serve the Zulkirs. She only serves her own ambition.~
@2862=~I fear your loyalty may be misguided. I recovered this letter in your physical sanctum. I believe Cherise was disobeying the Zulkirs when she came here and in fact plans to betray them.~
@2863=~I would tell you that this ruse to turn me against my charge are almost pitiful in their desperation and would demand your head as a matter of honor.~
@2864=~It's true, regardless if you believe me or not.~
@2865=~It is no ruse. Take this letter. I recovered it in your physical sanctum. I believe Cherise was disobeying the Zulkirs when she came here and plans to betray them.~
@2866=~My patience wears thin. While I like the woman little, I will answer challenges to her honor with my sword and blood! Bah! Let this damned charade be ended. I'll not listen to accusations from provincial boors.~
@2867=~Blood it will be then, Thayan!~
@2868=~Sit down, shut up, and look at this letter. I recovered it in your physical sanctum. Cherise was never heeded the orders of the Zulkirs and was always planning to betray them.~
@2869=~You must think me to be a complete imbecile to accept such an accusation without a shred of proof. This is going nowhere. Prepare yourselves for battle.~
@2870=~What?? Give me that! If this is a forgery, there will be no end to the pain that I will inflict on...~ 
@2871=~No this... this seal. The magical emblem. It can't be forged. And the handwriting. Cherise, what have you done? And a fool I've been to follow.~
@2872=~Do not dispair lass. Yer not the first to be stung by bitter betrayal.~
@2873=~I need to find and stop her. How can I get to her?~
@2874=~You'll find it impossible to do by any conventional or even magical manner now. Cherise sealed herself in her sanctum with wards that are quite unbreakable, at least not by any who do not exceed her own power in magic.~
@2875=~The only provision she gave to bypass these wards was if our mission was a success... myself and the other cohorts she sent out to tame this impossible situation.~
@2876=~Each of us holds a gemstone that are each a part of a key. Assemble all four gemstones and bring them to the foothold of the great tower that floats above us. Only then will the wards give you entry. Here is mine.~
@2877=~As for the others, you will need to traverse this realm to acquire them from the others. I'd ask you to treat with my fellows respectfully and ask before taking them off their corpses, but I think I am the last one left.~
@2878=~Go then. My men and I must rest and collect ourselves. Should you succeed, perhaps we can escape this damnable place as well. Unless there was something else?~
@2879=~Is there any way for me to convince you to help us?~
@2880=~Is there any information you can give us as to her capabilities? What we can expect?~
@2881=~What escaped creatures can I expect to find here?~
@2882=~That will be all. Farewell, Blackguard.~
@2883=~No. I am wounded and my vows keep me from working with you further. While you may no longer be my enemy, we are not allies.~
@2884=~I hardly need warn you that Cherise is no middling wizard, do I? If what I've heard about you is true, you may have faced a spellcaster or two that approached her power, but never one that was her equal. And you'll have to contend with her bodyguards as well. A Rakshasa, itself no novice in magic, and a Cambion who would put even my fighting prowess to shame.~
@2885=~There were four containment areas. The first housed a number of Slimes and Trolls. The second a Shambling Mound and Clay Golems. The third was a cadre of Ice Salamanders. The last a Fire Giant priest of some mad would-be god. Thankfully, he still remains in containment.~
@2886=~Ugh. I am disgusted that allies have come to see us in such disarray. If you are agents of Sarevok though, I could use your assistance.~ 
@2887=~I am Krotia the Black, enforcer to the will of the Zulkirs. I came here under the charge of Cherise as her guardian. Unfortunately, she has chosen to cast me out of her service on this damnable suicide mission.~
@2888=~She has sent myself and several of her other lieutenants out to try and regain control of this domain after our magical containments were released due to an intruder.~
@2889=~If you wish to earn favor with my Lady, and your masters as well of course, assist me in my charge. Clear this plane of any remaining creatures. If you find any Thayans left alive, usher them back to me. Otherwise, recover the gemstones they carry. They are needed to enter Cherise's sanctum.~
@2890=~Who was this intruder you mentioned earlier?~
@2891=~Kill the creatures? I thought they were to be given to Sarevok?~
@2892=~What are these gemstones?~
@2893=~Someone we never expected who had power enough to challenge even my master. We never saw her coming and she left before we could form an effective response. Hence the current crisis.~ 
@2894=~We believe she is working with an enemy of your own master, Rasaesh. Together, those two have proved quite the irritation for both of us.~
@2895=~We've lost that opportunity. I'll leave the begging for forgiveness to Cherise. They must now be put down and this demesne secured before their rampage destroys what little standing ground we have!~
@2896=~Cherise feared that someone might attack her directly, so warded her sanctum with powerful magic. It only will open when all four of the gemstones she assigned to us are brought together again and presented at the foot of the fortress.~
@2897=~Then I think I'll just be taking yours. Hand it over.~
@2898=~The report from Sarevok must be presented to her as soon as possible. If you could give me your gem and allow me to complete the rest of your task, I can bring the report to Cherise directly and then send back for you and your men.~
@2899=~Hmn. Reasonable, very well. As much as it shames me to say, you look like you'll have a better chance at performing this duty than I. I need time to recover anyway.~
@2900=~I wish you luck. I need to get somewhere safe and recover. Keep your eyes ever on the mission.~
@2901=~Why do you delay so? Speak now, or draw blades!~

// Malachai

@2902=~Mistress...~
@2903=~The alarm to the extradimensional cells has just been tripped. There's an breach in our astral demesne.~
@2904=~Aye, my lady. They will not draw breath outside of this chamber again.~

// Nerys

@2905=~*whispers* Shhhh... hey hey, keep it down! I'm trying to listen in on something here!~
@2906=~Boo, you must be quiet! We are being sneaky ones now!~
@2907=~Why bother listening? Just walk up and kill them already!~
@2908=~Huh?~
@2909=~*watch silently*~
@2910=~*whispers loudly* Ahah! Finally! After all this time! I'll be able to report this criminal ring and bust 'em for good! It's gonna be some kinda magical bomb or mystical plague or somethin, I just know it! The bosses are gonna be -so happy- heee! It's going to be the best day of my entire LIFE.~
@2911=~...~
@2912=~*whispers* C'mon, c'mon, open it. Show momma what's in the package...~
@2913=~*whispers* Ugh, hurry up already. Jeez, my great grandmother opens parcels faster, and she's got no hands!~
@2914=~What in the nine hells...~
@2915=~WAIT WAIT WAIT HOLD UP. You mean I kept tabs on the both of you in agonizing detail for three weeks, playing in crappy bars and expending valuable gold to track that package, and it had BABY CLOTHES IN IT???~
@2916=~Aren't you two Zhentish criminals, looking to smuggle weapons or illegal magic or drugs or ANYTHING into the city??~
@2917=~GOND DAMN IT. This is the WORST day of my ENTIRE LIFE. UGH.~
@2918=~Lousy gnomes! This is like listenin to one of them annoyin' twitter birds. Do we really gotta pay attention to this?~
@2919=~Hey hey! You're good. Don't be sad. Aww, if you frown I don't think my heart's going to be able to recover. She's so cute!~
@2920=~Uhh... so are you Nerys?~
@2921=~Life is full of disappointments. Don't let it get you down, kid.~
@2922=~Are you always like this?~
@2923=~Wait. Who wants to know? Are you with the Zhents? The Night Knives? The Iron Throne??~
@2924=~The Zhents, oh nooo certainly not. If someone suggested such a thing, I'd have ta be gettin' stabby...~
@2925=~My name is <CHARNAME>. I am not affiliated with any of those organizations, but I am an enemy of the Iron Throne.~
@2926=~Stop being ridiculous. I am <CHARNAME>, I've come here for information.~
@2927=~Hey, I'm not a kid! I've probably got more summers than you do. Who are you?~
@2928=~It's not so bad, people thinking you're a child all the time. You get lots of free candy!~
@2929=~Ugh, no I'm not always like this! Who even are you?~
@2930=~Wait, <CHARNAME>? I've heard of you! Whispers in the taverns say you've been a thorn under the paw of the Iron Throne. Which means you're a friend of mine! So long as ya don't call me tiny, pipsqueak, or shortstack, whatever that means.~
@2931=~My name's Nerys. Which you probably knew! Uhh... did you also know that I'm a part of... you know...?~
@2932=~The Harpers?~
@2933=~Yes, I know.~
@2934=~The Lollipop Guild?~
@2935=~Oh my, you're very well informed. How did you know that?~
@2936=~Uhh... well, a bartender told us you were a nosy musician so we just kind of assumed...~
@2937=~It took a fortune in time and resources, but I'm so glad our contacts were correct. We could really use your help.~
@2938=~What? No! I'm a Harper! I'm not a mem-Frick! Wait, you're just messing with me! I know that you already knew that!~
@2939=~*sigh* I am going to have to have a talk with -someone- about this.~
@2940=~Oh uh, hi Jaheira. I've heard about you. S-sorry.~
@2941=~Calm down, Nerys. Yes, we knew you were a Harper.~
@2942=~You're not very good at this, are you?~
@2943=~Really?? That's all it took?? *sigh* Nerys, you're the worst Harper ever...~
@2944=~Ah, there there, little one. Y-you are far from the worst, I can tell you that! Don't be discouraged.~
@2945=~Well, hold on there, maybe you can still help us. We're looking into another Harper named Riezen Darkeyes. Have you heard of him?~
@2946=~Yeah, but you're all I've got. You haven't happened to have heard of another Harper named Riezen Darkeyes, have you?~
@2947=~Aha! I knew it wouldn't be so easy to track me down! Oh Nerys, maybe you're gettin' better at this afterall!~
@2948=~Oh yeah, you were just the hardest to track down. Hardest thing we've done since startin' out adventurin'. Yer a *master* spy.~
@2949=~<CHARNAME>, please don't take this away from her. She just needs a win.~ 
@2950=~Definitely. But if you'd really like to help, we're looking into another Harper named Riezen Darkeyes. Have you heard of him?~
@2951=~(she believed me, gods help us all) Uhh... well, we're looking into another Harper named Riezen Darkeyes. Have you heard of him?~
@2952=~Oh, thank goodness. If the bosses knew I was letting that slip, I'd be out before I could say Garl Glittergold... so what did you need me for?~
@2953=~We're looking into another Harper named Riezen Darkeyes. Have you heard of him?~
@2954=~*sigh* I know. I'm the worst. Ugh, I shoulda never joined up...~
@2955=~Yes yes, you'll probably fail at most things you try. I suppose we shouldn't let that stop us, even if it's all so unbearable sometimes.~
@2956=~Well, hold on there, maybe you can still help us. We're looking into another Harper named Riezen Darkeyes. Have you heard of him?~
@2957=~Yeah, but you're all I've got. You haven't happened to have heard of another Harper named Riezen Darkeyes, have you?~
@2958=~Riezen Darkeyes? Hmm, yeah that name's familiar. I think... mmm...~
@2959=~It seems like he is in Baldur's Gate. We were meeting with a Red Wizard defector. He assassinated the defector and then tried to kill me.~
@2960=~Wait, Red Wizards in Baldur's Gate? Assassinations? The enemy of the Iron Throne before me!? Oh that's... that's... incredible! I mean, I'm awfully sorry people are trying to kill you. But how exciting!~
@2961=~The city truly is a den of vipers. Evil of all kinds dwells in every shadow.~
@2962=~Danger and Excitement are faithful companions and passionate lovers. You cannot name a more iconic duo.~
@2963=~This is serious. What do you know about him? I need to find him.~
@2964=~It is pretty thrilling, isn't it? But it's all just another day in the life of <CHARNAME>.~
@2965=~C'mon, it's not far from here. I'll lead the way and we'll be there in no time!~
@2966=~Well, I don't know exactly where he is. I just remember seeing him in some missives. Oh Nerys, think... think!~
@2967=~Wait, I know! Come back with me to my home. I can go through my records and see if we can find a hit. He'll surely be in there somewhere.~
@2968=~We're actually going to its... den? This is a terrible idea. It probably smells like that disgustingly sweet candy that surfacers seem to all crave.~
@2969=~A grand idea! Mayhaps I can see your bone cellar while we're there? I'd love to compare with my own.~
@2970=~Uh, I don't have one of those?~
@2971=~Disappointing. Well, I can show you how to get started at least.~
@2972=~N-no thanks!~
@2973=~Research? Fun.~
@2974=~Ok, we'll come with you.~
@2975=~Is there any way that you can just do this on your own?~
@2976=~Oh, that's so amazing. That's the life I dreamed of when I joined the Harpers. Oh, not of my life being constantly threatened, but meeting with heroes who do!~
@2977=~Well, you can help this particular hero by giving <PRO_HIMHER> some ideas of where to find him?~
@2978=~Alright, got everything. Here. Luckily, I ordered everything alphanumerically, by date, and categorized according to possible danger. I should be able to find any references to Riezen Darkeyes in no time at all!~
@2979=~Hmm hmm... yes yes, that's all fairly well done, but have you thought about organizing according to largeness too?~
@2980=~Uh, no I can't say that I have...~
@2981=~You what?~
@2982=~Do you need any help?~
@2983=~Oh uh, nothing. Just have spent a lot of time organizing these. But it's all going to pay off now. Now lets see what I got here...~
@2984=~Perhaps it would be faster if we helped. If you'd let me look at them, I could perhaps read them as well.~
@2985=~Oh, uh, these aren't just using a Harper code. They're double encoded just in case there were any Harper spies. So even if you wanted to help, they're probably pretty unreadable to anyone but, well, me. Sorry! It shouldn't take too long, I promise.~
@2986=~I appreciate the offer, but these are all written in code. It'd take longer to explain how to read it than it would be to just sift through it all myself. Sorry! It shouldn't take too long, I promise.~
@2987=~Alright, so these messages here do mention a Riezen Darkeyes. Mmm... mmhmm... oh! Hmm. That's... hrmm... fascinating....~
@2988=~What? What is it?! Tell Tiax this INSTANT! He demands it!~
@2989=~What is it? The suspense is killing me!~
@2990=~Are you going to sit there squeaking all night or...?~
@2991=~*wait patiently*~
@2992=~Oh, sorry! I can be pretty animated when I read, I know. So this message here actually contains a profile on this guy. Confirms my suspicions, he's not considered a Harper anymore. In fact, orders are to detain him if he's found again.~
@2993=~A Harper t-t-traitor? That's very serious. We must treat this s-situation with care.~
@2994=~Sounds serious. What did he do?~
@2995=~Anything important you can tell me about his powers? Any weaknesses?~
@2996=~Do they say where he might be found?~
@2997=~Mmm, these don't explain in any more detail. He pursued a "target" into Underdark, disappeared for a few years, and broke contact with his handlers. Oh, looks like he killed someone that was sent in after him too.~
@2998=~The Underground is no place for those who follow the Oak Father's teachings. Likely, he was corrupted and must be put down like a rabid animal.~
@2999=~Anything important you can tell me about his powers? Any weaknesses?~
@3000=~Do they say where he might be found?~
@3001=~Aha! Here it is. A treasure trove of missives about our Ex-Harper. So this message here actually contains a profile on this guy. Confirms my suspicions, he's not considered a Harper anymore. In fact, orders are to detain him if he's found again.~
@3002=~Well, he's a druid, but you knew that. His skills as a spy were well respected. He could see through the eyes of animals, which meant nobody could hide secrets from him. Seems like his time in Underdark gave him an affinity for spiders. Ew. Erratic personality though. Or, actually it says here he wasn't always like that. He was dedicated and loyal to the Harper cause. Guess just something happened to him.~
@3003=~Guess it's true what they say about people who chase monsters. The line between them gets thinner as the years go by. As for weaknesses, nothing really here. Affinity for spiders probably means bring along any kind of anti-spider equipment you can get if you plan to fight him.~
@3004=~That means anti-toxins and ways to free one from webbing should anyone blunder into it.~
@3005=~Uhh... no. He's been such a recluse for so long, it's impossible to say where he might be. The Harpers didn't seem to really have much of a clue, or else they would have gone after him.~
@3006=~Oh, but wait. Here, there's a reference to a nearby gorge that used to be a hideout for Harpers on the run. Hasn't been used for a while, so much so that it's been overgrown and not even they seem to know where it is. Might be a perfect hideout, if he was nearby. Yeah. I think that's our best bet. If only we could find it.~
@3007=~Oh Gond damn it, there's nothing in here to narrow down the location. I don't kn-~
@3008=~Woah! A projected image? *low whistle* Who's your friend packing the major mojo, <CHARNAME>?~
@3009=~I'm coming too! I know I might not have been the most help this time, but I know I can be of use to you! Please!~ 
@3010=~Hello miss Illasera. I've heard so much about you on the way over. So what's the plan?~
@3011=~Riezen *was* a master spy, afterall. If he's anything like his reputation frames him as, he might know everything there is to know about the Red Wizards.~
@3012=~Than-Oh... I... r-right. S-sorry.~
@3013=~*say nothing*~
@3014=~Don't take it personally, Nerys. She's like that with everyone.~
@3015=~Hey, Illasera, lay it off Nerys a little. She's still new to this, but I'm sure she'll prove herself.~
@3016=~I-it's fine. I can take it. You don't have to worry about me, <CHARNAME>.~
@3017=~Hey, it's no big. Water under the bridge. I'll just have to show you what a real Harper can do, that's all.~
@3018=~And I'm gonna go put my ear to the streets and see if there's any chatter about these Red Wizards. Uh, let me know if you'd like to talk before you go though, <CHARNAME>.~
@3019=~Oh, <CHARNAME>, I knew you'd come for me! Thank Gond you're here.~
@3020=~Are you alright, Nerys?~
@3021=~You should have been more careful.~
@3022=~I'm fine. Good, really! They just tried to scare me, but I didn't talk! No matter how much they yelled, these lips remained sealed.~
@3023=~*wince* Uh, then they started pulling off nails. I uh, might have told them everything then. But I did it so quick and screamy that I don't think they understood a word of it. Nails grow back, right?~
@3024=~Eh, walk it off ya lil shrimp. You'll be fine.~
@3025=~Oh, those are some big old ouchies! Would it make you feel better if I gave you a piece of candy? It's butterscotch!~
@3026=~A little bit?~
@3027=~Even still, you kept your cool when tortured by Vampire Spawn. Impressive.~
@3028=~Good job. Your note mentioned that you found out something about the Red Wizards?~
@3029=~I know I know. I was careful, but I didn't expect to be grabbed by thieves. Oh, but you won't believe what I was able to find!~
@3030=~Wait, those guys were VAMPIRES? Oh sheesh, I had no idea. Ugh, shivers up my spine, that mighta changed everything. So that's why they were looking at me like I was a snack. Err... I mean, you took care of them though, so I guess things are ok.~
@3031=~Worry not! Those foul vampire-spawn have been eliminated with the full fury of Helm's justice!~
@3032=~Your note mentioned that you found out something about the Red Wizards?~ 
@3033=~Ok well it started right after you left. I went off to some of the bars in town, to see if... oh, wait, how did things go with Riezen?~
@3034=~The same as things ever go. Poorly, and we are lucky to grasp at what pyrrhic victory we can.~
@3035=~Not great. Had to kill him.~
@3036=~They went fine. Or at least I'm fine. He's dead.~
@3037=~Stay on topic please. What did you find?~
@3038=~Damn. Sorta was hoping that he would turn around from whatever path he was on and, ya know, like join back up into the Harpers. Oh well. Uh, anyways.~
@3039=~Oh, sorry! Just wanted to make sure things went ok, but if you're back then I guess that means they did, at least reasonably so.~
@3040=~Right! So, after you left, I went around to a few of the seedier bars around town. Kept my ears and eyes open for anything about red figures or mysterious people about dark. While doing some snooping at the Blade and Stars, I saw a cloaked man ordering a few bottles of wine at the bar and noticed something strange... just under his hood was a red inlay, very curious!~
@3041=~So I followed him out of the bar (after taking a sip of an invisibility potion to conceal myself) and saw him crawl down into the sewers by there. After going into the sewers, he turned and headed ah... west, I think it was. He goes down the tunnels a bit and then speaks the phrase, “The Light of Thay will Illuminate the Darkest Shores” and then passed through what had looked like just a wall a moment before!~
@3042=~I came up out of the tunnel and went back to my house to see if I could find any more information about where those sewer tunnels might have led to. That’s when I sent out the note to Illasera. It turns out, there's this whole little sanctum down there that's been around for hundreds of years! That's where the Red Wizards set up.~
@3043=~But... as I was leaving to go meet you, those pale freaks scooped me up. They held me here until you came, and where we are.~
@3044=~Great job Nerys. Do you need any help getting home?~
@3045=~Pretty good, for a pipsqueak. Get out of here, we’ve got Red Wizards to kill.~
@3046=~Aww, don't mention it. And no, I should be fine. It's not far, and I doubt there's any more of these pale freaks around.~
@3047=~Thanks. Maybe I'll see you again.~
@3048=~Wait, before you go. Riezen had a journal on him that looks to be written in code. Do you think you could take a look at it?~
@3049=~Err thanks, I guess... I'll just head back home then. It's not far, and I doubt there's any more of these pale freaks around~
@3050=~Just remember, down the sewers in the southeast of town and then take the tunnel west. Hopefully if you repeat the phrase, you'll be able to get through to the other side. See you around!~
@3051=~In code? Hmm, let me see that.~
@3052=~Fascinating. This is pretty intense. But I think I recognize some of the elements of the cipher. It’s based in some old Harper code language. I need to cross reference with my materials back home. I’ll get started on this right away! Might be a bit until I uncover anything, but I’ll let you know when I have.~
@3053=~<CHARNAME>, you're back! And safe! And alive! Didja get me any souvenirs from the Red Wizard’s lair? A red scarf or maybe some ridiculously gaudy jewelry?~
@3054=~Nerys! I’m glad to see you safe. Did you make it back alright?~
@3055=~Nothing I can spare. Where is Illasera? I need to speak with her.~
@3056=~Oh c'mon, ya don't gotta be like that. I know I've already been kidnapped once since you've met me, but this won't be a trend... Err, I hope. But I'm fine, thank you for asking!~
@3057=~And Illasera...? She's not here. I think she might be in danger.~
@3058=~Did you see Illasera before you arrived? I need to speak with her.~
@3059=~Uh, yeah, about her. She left right after I rushed in the door, did her wiggley finger thing and stepped through a magical gate. Didn’t hardly speak a word at me as to why, just that she was ‘managing the situation’. I thought she was going to help you. Did something go wrong?~
@3060=~While I eliminated most of the Red Wizard agents, their leader teleported away as I went to confront them. It seems they were being attacked on a second front. Some 'Extradimensional base' we didn't know about.~
@3061=~So she went off to attack them there...? I hope th-~
@3062=~Yes, miss Illasera?~
@3063=~Ok, rude, but fair. But I'd love to! Just gotta get my harp from the back. Vic always lets me use one of his spares so I don't gotta lug it back and forth across town. Uh, that is, if he still isn't holding that incident last week against me...~
@3064=~*strums her harp idly* What'll it be then? In the mood for anything in particular?~
@3065=~Trying to challenge me? Hm. I think I know just the thing.~
@3066=~*She begins to strum the harp strings in earnest, playing out a gentle tune*~
@3067=~<CHARNAME>, there you are! Oh thank goodness I found you!~
@3068=~Nerys! It's good to see you again!~
@3069=~Hello little one. Were you looking for me?~
@3070=~Ah, it's you. What is it?~
@3071=~Aww, really? Heh, well shucks! Oh, but I didn't come find you just for pleasantries, it's about that book you gave me to translate!~
@3072=~Did you find out anything?~
@3073=~Well, don't sound too excited to see me. Oh, but I didn't come find you just for pleasantries, it's about that book you gave me to translate!~
@3074=~Did I ever! That book was a treasure trove of fun tidbits and interesting facts to know and share. That Riezen sure had a lotta history to him. Sad how things turned out though...~
@3075=~Oh, but yes! I was able to translate most of the text. I scribed the important looking entries for you. I figured it'd be something you'd wanna check out. Here, go ahead and take it!~ 
@3076=~Thanks Nerys. You've been a great help.~
@3077=~I'll be taking that. You did good, pipsqueak.~
@3078=~Nerys, I'm about to confront Sarevok. This may prove to be my most difficult trial yet. If I don't make it out the other side, just know that it was good to know you.~
@3079=~Hey, don't mention it. I guess you're about to go confront Sarevok and settle this whole duke business, huh? Listen, just so you know, I'm rootin' for ya in there. Go be a big damn hero!~
@3080=~Ugh, I really wish you wouldn't call me that! *sigh* I guess you're about to go confront Sarevok and settle this whole duke business, huh? Listen, just so you know, I'm rootin' for ya in there. Go be a big damn hero!~ 
@3081=~R-really? That means a lot more than you might think to me. And likewise, I'm glad I got to know you too. I hope we can meet again soon. Maybe grab a bite to eat or something? Uh, if you're interested, that is.~
@3082=~A-anyway! I guess you're about to go confront Sarevok and settle this whole duke business, huh? Listen, just so you know, I'm rootin' for ya in there. Go be a big damn hero!~
@3083=~Oh, <CHARNAME>, what can I do for you?~
@3084=~I didn't get to ask everything I wanted to about Riezen. Mind if I ask a few more things?~
@3085=~You must know quite a bit about the city. What's been going on in Baldur's Gate?~
@3086=~Do you mind if I ask a few things about you?~
@3087=~Have you heard any rumors lately?~
@3088=~Nothing right now. Thanks Nerys.~
@3089=~So, what else can I help you with?~
@3090=~Well, it sure isn't quiet in Baldur's Gate these days, I'll tell you that. Trade organizations that have been around for generations are dropping left and right. But not because trade's bad... there's more of a need for trade now than I've ever seen before. At the center of it all seems to be the Iron Throne.~
@3091=~Even the shadier elements in the city seem to be spooked by how tumultuous it all is. Criminals are usually the quickest to adapt and take advantage of chaotic situations, but even they seem unprepared. That should tell you all you need to know.~
@3092=~Besides that? Well... the carnival's in town. That's pretty neat. You should take some time to go there and get your fortune told.~
@3093=~You want to know about me? Well sure, I'm an open book! Except without the eye strain by candlelight, heh.~
@3094=~Err... wait, I didn't mean that to come out like that. F-forget I said that. What did you want to know?~
@3095=~Where do you come from?~
@3096=~So you're a bard?~
@3097=~How'd you become a Harper?~
@3098=~How old are you anyway?~
@3099=~Gnomes aren't very common here, are they? You ever feel lonely?~
@3100=~No more personal questions.~
@3101=~Was there anything else you wanted to know about me?~
@3102=~A small town called Hardbuckler out in the Heartlands. Most have never heard of it. It's not a terribly exciting place. But it is the largest population of gnomes above-ground this side of the Sea of Fallen Stars.~
@3103=~Not much to say about it. One of those small communities where practically everyone knows the other's name. I left as soon as I came of age. Life in the big city always called to me over smalltown life.~
@3104=~Yeah! Well, no. I mean, I guess "Bard" around here means someone who can do some magic and fighting in addition to playing music and knowing about lore and stuff. I mostly can just to the latter two.~
@3105=~But I think I can play pretty well. Harp mostly, but these fingers can find their way around just about any stringed instrument. A few woodwinds too. Oh, and I can whistle a jaunty shanty like nobody's business.~
@3106=~Just don't ask me to sing. You, uh, don't want to hear me try to sing.~
@3107=~Same way most become Harpers. An existing member sees them, thinks they might have what it takes, and tutors them. Mine was an old elf man who took care of me when I first came to the city, Maerick Sunstone. Taught me everything I ever needed to know about Harpering.~
@3108=~Poor guy met his end going down the wrong alleyway on his way home one night. Mugging that went bad. Or at least, that's what the Flaming Fist said. He probably had old enemies, so I've always suspected assassination. Never was able to track down his killer though.~
@3109=~That's rather personal, isn't it? I know, I'm a gnome so I seem young to a lot of bigger races. But I've lived forty-six summers.~
@3110=~Sometimes lonely, sure, but not cause there aren't many other gnomes around here. I mean, other gnomes are fine, but I'm just as comfortable around the bigger folk. Prefer them, actually! Although sometimes it's hard to get them to notice me.~
@3111=~I wouldn't do much shopping at Lucky Aello's Discount Store. I have a sneaking suspicion he's a devil in disguise, tricking people into buying cursed objects.~
@3112=~I hear some real shady types frequent the second floor of the Sorcerous Sundries. Don't go poking around up there unless you're ready for a fight.~
@3113=~If you're looking for some more uh, bawdy entertainment, the Low Lantern down by the docks is your best bet. No judgments!~
@3114=~Getting a shop to run a store in the city is really expensive, so a lot of people just sell goods right out of their homes.~
@3115=~There's a fortune teller staying at the Blade and Stars Inn. I hear he can provide a telling if you deliver him a gem of some kind.~
@3116=~Not that I should have to say this, but be careful just walking into one of the nicer homes in the city. You really don't want to irritate one of the resident wizards here by intruding.~
@3117=~Baldur's Gate has a seedy side, called the Undercellar. You can reach it through the Blushing Mermaid. I hear there's also an entrance through the sewers, but I doubt you'll get much attention there showing up smelling like sewage.~
@3118=~The sewers of Baldur's Gate are home to all manner of creepy crawlies. There's a serious infestation of Carrion Crawlers down there currently, and nobody seems willing to go down there and clean them out.~

// Night Knife

@3119=~Ey, ye lookin' for the lil' gnomie?~
@3120=~Nerys? Yes, I am.~
@3121=~Where is she?~
@3122=~We've taken her for "safe keepin". Stop lookin' inta the affairs of the Red Wizards, else she'll be meetin' an unkind fate.~
@3123=~Ah well, the annoying little pipsqueak's done for. Let us go to the nearest tavern to celebrate!~
@3124=~No! We must take battle to these rogues and save the little one! She is too tiny to defend herslf!~
@3125=~It seems our friend may have gotten in over her head. We must step lightly to ensure her safety.~
@3126=~Who are you?~
@3127=~You won't get away with this.~
@3128=~It don't matter. The Night Knives give no second warnings. Lucky enough ta have even been given a first. Watch yer step.~

@3129=~*A magical veil swirls about in the space before the Sanctum. Yet it seems too thin to pass through.*~

@3132=~*A magical veil swirls about in the space before the Sanctum. Yet it seems too thin to pass through.~
@3133=~*With the gemstones presented before it, the veil thickens and forms a portalway into the Sanctum. You sense that if you step in now, there will be no going back.~

@3137=~This darthirii utters abyssal. Kill her quickly, lest whatever demon grips her soul looks to us next.~
@3138=~Foul magic has taken this poor lass. By Tempus' will, we must perform an exorcism at once!~
@3139=~This elf’s spirit has been gripped by fiendish intent! We need to initiate a cleansing ritual at once, or she will be lost.~
@3140=~Ach, the poor lass. Taken by a demon no doubt. Ye give me the word, n’ I’ll give it a whoopin’ that’ll send it scurryin’ back to its pit.~
@3141=~Hello? Can you hear me?~
@3142=~Not so quickly, Viconia. Is there any way you can help her?~ 
@3143=~Branwen, are you able to conduct such a ritual?~
@3144=~Ajantis, are you able cleanse her?~
@3145=~Are you sure you can do this Yeslick?~
@3146=~A demonic possession. With the strength of my faith, I should be able to cleanse her. But it will manifest the demon into physical form to attack us. Prepare yourselves, everyone!~
@3147=~A demonic possession. With the strength of my faith, I should be able to cleanse her. But it will manifest the demon into physical form to attack us. Prepare yourselves, everyone!~

@3150=~*Try to take the mirror she holds in her hands*~
@3151=~It doesn’t seem that there is any helping her. It would be a mercy to kill her, now.~
@3152=~I'm not getting through to her. But there has to be something we can do. Lets come back at another time~
@3153=~*You draw a knife from your pack and slit her throat. As the life fades from her, you take a small hand mirror she clutches*~
@3154=~*Her hands hold tight in a death grip, strong beyond all reason. You won't be able to get it from her like this.*~
@3155=~It doesn’t seem that there is any helping her. It would be a mercy to kill her, now.~
@3156=~I'm not getting through to her. But there has to be something we can do. Lets come back at another time~
@3157=~*You begin the ritual that will pull the demon out from the elvish woman and manifest it for you to fight.*~
@3158=~W-where am I? Who are.... W-what’s going on?~
@3159=~Hey sit down, have some water. Give yourself a minute before you worry about all that.~
@3160=~I was hired to look for your expedition. You were possessed by a demon. I was able to draw it out of you and defeat it.~
@3161=~Are you ok, miss?~
@3162=~Collect yourself later. You have a mirror that I was hired to retrieve. Hand it over.~
@3163=~A demon? That doesn’t make any... well, wait, I remember the excavation... and then traveling the road up north. And then the nightmares. Oh gods, the nightmares...~
@3164=~Oh the way she trembles when she recalls her horrors. Quite delectable, I would like to hear them in full.~
@3165=~Thou hast seen terrible things. But remember thine recollections are merely a passing illusion. Thou must center thyself in the here and now. Feel the dirt 'twixt thine fingers and smell the dew in the air. Tis the only way to know reality from not.~
@3166=~I... th-thank you. I think I am going to be ok.~
@3167=~You’ve been through a lot. Take a moment, try to recall what happened.~
@3168=~Collect yourself later. You have a mirror. Hand it over.~
@3169=~I think so? I don’t know. I feel funny... tingly but also tightness in my breath, like I was being strangled or choked by something and can only just now breathe. And the nightmares. Oh gods, the nightmares.~ 
@3170=~You’ve been through a lot. I was hired here to retrieve the mirror you hold, but first I’d like you to take a moment and try to recall what happened.~
@3171=~You have a mirror with you that I need. I came here to retrieve it for a collector. May I have it?~
@3172=~The mirror? Oh yes, the mirror! We found it in the excavation. A mirror of true seeing, or so I thought. Are you the intermediary? They sent me up so I could give a presentation to mister Yarel about our findings. Here, let me just...~
@3173=~Well, I’m a proud member of the Archeology Guild of Baldur’s Gate! We were recently commissioned to go down to a tomb that was uncovered recently. We were funded by mister Yarel, a noble in Baldur’s Gate. The tomb that they uncovered was of one of Alaundo’s disciples, can you believe it? Such an exciting discovery! We found the mirror in an old vault and thought it would be an excellent showpiece for our progress.~
@3174=~I don't suppose you bothered to have an arcane examination of the object before arresting it into your possession did you? No, of course not, why does it even matter?~
@3175=~But then there were the mercenaries he sent there too as protection. The Happy Companions. Oh, I started to think that they were actually sent down there to make sure we didn’t try to steal anything we found! They were mean and brutish! They had no interest in what a wonderful archeological find, just in whatever shiny baubles they could get. Ah, I suppose that's them lying around this cave. Kinda a shame...~
@3176=~*spits* The only shame is that they died too quickly. I wanted to test myself, not be a damn executioner!~
@3177=~They escorted me up north to meet with an intermediate. The creepy elf with the scars on his lips kept looking at the mirror though. He seemed obsessed with it. As we got close to the crossroads, he asked us all to look into it, one by one. But after each of them looked at it, they started to look... wrong in the eyes. It was so frightening! I didn’t want to look, but they grabbed me and forced me to hold it, forced my eyes open to look at it. And when I looked into it I saw...~
@3178=~I don’t know what I saw. Things got... fuzzy then. Don’t remember anything after that.~
@3179=~I’m suspecting this mirror was not the innocuous magical artifact you assumed it was at first.~
@3180=~I’d like to take a look at the mirror myself. Can you hand it to me?~
@3181=~It’s broken. Or... the glass is gone. Like it melted away. Oh, I think whatever just happened here may have destroyed it. I’m... sorry.~
@3182=~It'll be difficult to con someone into taking it in that shape. I might just have a hand mirror we could spruce up to stand in for the real thing though...~
@3183=~Likely for the best. After what happened here, it’d take either a fool or a villain to just hand this over for a bounty.~
@3184=~Just give me the frame. That will have to do.~
@3185=~No, it seems like it wasn’t. To think I almost gave our benefactor something that could have hurt him! Oh, I’d have been kicked out of the Archeology Guild for sure! Oh, but why am I getting ahead of myself like that... thank you so so much for saving me! If you came for the mirror, we should...~
@3186=~Lucky for me, you seem to be neither. Oh, the archeology guild is not going to be happy about all this. With the mirror broken, you don't have a way to get paid either, do you?~
@3187=~We'll see. Mind I take that frame anyway? I think I'll at least need to show what happened to it.~
@3188=~Of course! It’s the least I can do for saving my life! Here, have it, have it!~
@3189=~I’ll need to warn the expedition team about the mirror. There could be more dangerous things down there! It would be a dereliction of the Archeologists Code not to keep them informed.~
@3190=~S-she is rather charming, isn't she? Her ex-excitement is such a refreshment!~
@3191=~Oh? Charming is she? Refreshing? Please, do go on.~
@3192=~Sh-she is a vibrant emerald, b-but nothing compares to the brilliant d-d-diamond that you are, my wife.~
@3193=~Good save, dear.~
@3194=~Do you need an escort there?~
@3195=~Well, I wish you luck. Take care.~
@3196=~Oh no, I couldn’t possibly ask you to do that after all you’ve helped me with already. We’re still by the crossroads, right? That means a short walk up to the Friendly Arm. I’ll be able to charter a messenger there. Thank you so so much for all you’ve done for me. Oh, my name is Presfiel by the way! I hope to see you around again sometime!~
@3197=~Fair luck to you, mysterious savior people! Oh, my name is Presfiel, by the way! Maybe I’ll see you again.~

// Artin

@3198=~Speak with miss Illasera first, please.~
@3199=~My name is Artin, sir. It is good to see one of House Odesseiron in this savage land. I hope your own mission here has been fruitful.~
@3200=~(It has been too long since I have met one who was properly subservient to his superiors.) Yes yes, do continue. Tell us what you know.~
@3201=~You are correct. It seems that the reputation of my kind precedes me. My name is Artin. I am a mere novitiate, but yes, I am a member of that esteemed order.~
@3202=~You are <CHARNAME>? I have heard mention of your name. The Iron Throne seems to be quite invested in your demise. I came here with a contingent of other Red Wizards. The truth is, the Iron Throne's operations are part of a far larger conspiracy.~
@3203=~The Red Wizards, here? Tis most dire news. Their schemes ever run deep.~
@3204=~Worry not my witch! Minsc will be your shield while Boo's keen eyes hold watch. No wizard tricks will stop us!~
@3205=~Great, so the Red Wizards are involved in this as well?~
@3206=~A bigger conspiracy than what is already happening? I swear, this plot is like an onion.~
@3207=~First, allow me to be honest with you and tell you that I am a Red Wizard of Thay. A novitiate yet, but I only say so because there are many who distrust our order. I would not want to foster further distrust by hiding this from you.~
@3208=~Please, I beg civility. Allow me to be honest with you and tell you that I am a Red Wizard, of Thay. A novitiate yet, but I only say so because there are many who distrust our order. I would not want to foster further distrust by hiding this from you.~
@3209=~Not directly with the Iron Throne. The leader of our group has some history with an advisor to one of the leaders of the Throne. She brought us here to meet him. We all came, thinking we might find some power or profit from this but... what I heard. I could not remain with them after learning their plan.~
@3210=~You dare to disobey your master and betray your Thayan brothers and sisters?~
@3211=~No. They did not come here with the official sanction of Thay. If the Zulkirs heard what they were planning... no no, I can't even imagine.~
@3212=~So what is it? What did you learn?~
@3213=~Thank you for having the courage to defect. It could not have been easy.~
@3214=~Come on, man. Spit it out.~
@3215=~Yes, I imagine for one who has not experienced the politics of Thay, this might all seem quite complicated. The leader of our group has some history with an advisor to one of the leaders of the Throne. She brought us here to meet him. We all came, thinking we might find some power or profit from this but... what I heard. I could not remain with them after learning their plan.~
@3216=~Yes. What I learned. Well, we met the advisor under the cover of night and he told us that he was a former culti...~
@3217=~What is the meaning of this? Get back! Get back damn you... wait are those... spiders??~
@3218=~Ew ew ew! Get them away, get them away!~
@3219=~AHHHHHH!!~

// Reizen Darkeyes

@3220=~Welcome you to my grove, <CHARNAME>. Excuse my surface tongue. It is... rusty with misuse. So much time under the ground has dulled it.~
@3221=~We have come to answer thy challenge!~
@3222=~H-have care when dealing with him. He l-looks to have hostages!~
@3223=~I don't wish to fight you. I've just come to talk.~
@3224=~Free these poor men at once. I'll not allow you to torture them further.~
@3225=~I don't appreciate attempts on my life. Tell me what I want, and I may spare you.~
@3226=~This obviously is only ending one way, and I would prefer we just skip the chatter. Time to die.~
@3227=~I could share a few words, certainly. But it will change nothing about how this meeting must end. We stand at odds with one another, and only death awaits us at the end.~
@3228=~This cur begs us to split him open. I say we skip the jabbering and grant his wish!~
@3229=~You were a Harper, surely that still means something to you. Why not help me?~
@3230=~I was meeting with a Red Wizard defector. You killed him. Why?~
@3231=~What do you know about the Red Wizards in Baldur's Gate?~
@3232=~Why are you trying to kill me?~
@3233=~It's hard to speak when these men by you are so obviously being tortured. Free them.~
@3234=~It's clear there's no talking to you. Let's end this.~
@3235=~Pity not the fly who strays into the spider's web. Their deaths were preordained. Besides, there is little of them left to save now. You need not concern yourself over their husks.~
@3236=~We're too late. Helm hear me, I will bring justice for these men!~
@3237=~If it wasn't obvious enough, <CHARNAME>, these men are already dead. But it's strange. This type of spider breeding within a host is only practiced by drow, and he is no drow.~
@3238=~I'll not let these crimes go unpunished. But first, I wish to know some things.~
@3239=~You're a monster. I'll not converse with you a second longer.~
@3240=~As it must be. If my suspicions about you are correct, your skull will be a welcome gift to my mistress, and the first of many that shall be laid upon her path. Sendai, witness me!~
@3241=~What do you know of what the Harpers stand for? Balance? Pfah. They uphold a status quo where they stand in a position of power and call that balance. No, the world is out of balance. It must be pushed into its rightful place. There will be no cooperation between us.~
@3242=~In another life, I might have called you friend. I will pray to the Oakfather for your spirit's passage.~
@3243=~The Harpers never put themselves into power, it is against everything that we hold sacred. What has twisted your mind so?~
@3244=~No, in the Underdark, I found visions of a new age. One who will rise to balance the scales of life and death! The Harpers stand in the way of true progress. For that, they must be destroyed!~
@3245=~Then there is to be no reasoning with you. It will bring me no pleasure to kill you.~
@3246=~I was meeting with a Red Wizard defector. You killed him. Why?~
@3247=~What do you know about the Red Wizards in Baldur's Gate?~
@3248=~Why are you trying to kill me?~
@3249=~It's hard to speak when these men by you are so obviously being tortured. Free them.~
@3250=~It's clear there's no talking to you. Let's end this.~
@3251=~Was it not enough for him to be a Red Wizard? And while I may no longer be a Harper, does not the hatred for their order still run deep in me?~
@3252=~Well, it's not like the world's going to miss another Red Wizard anyway.~
@3253=~You're avoiding the question. What was your reason, truly?~
@3254=~You were a Harper, surely that still means something to you. Why not help me?~
@3255=~That they do not belong. A great new dawn is coming to Faerun, and it begins on the Sword Coast. Red Wizard meddling will not be tolerated. The fact that they come to serve a Pretender is second cause for their annihilation.~
@3256=~All these vagueries are excessive, even to I. Thy mind is rattled, and as closed to thee as it is to us.~
@3257=~What dawn is coming? What is this 'pretender' you speak of?~
@3258=~The one I must kill defends himself well. But I may have access if I could provide the gift of your corpse. A corpse bursting to full with deadly progeny. I have other suspicions of your nature too but... no, I cannot speak of it.~
@3259=~He wants to turn us into those... husks. Oh ew ew ew I want to go back home...~
@3260=~What do you mean about my nature?~
@3261=~Knowledge is power, and you walk in ignorance. No, I will not enlighten you when it serves me better to kill a blind idiot.~
@3262=~It's not kind to point out how moronic my companions are. I'm doing my best to help them.~

@3294=~I've trained my whole life to hunt scum like you. Let fly these arrows! For Deheriana!~
@3295=~Bring it on.~
@3296=~My minions will overwhelm you! Come! Wash over these would be heroes! Hyaaaa!~

// Yujehli

@3297=~Shh. Keep it down! I'm hidin' over here.~
@3298=~What are you hiding from?~
@3299=~You're a well spoken goblin.~
@3300=~DIE GOBLIN!~
@3301=~From the thing! Over there! Ahh go away, before it notices me!~
@3302=~Uh, thanks, I guess? Ahh go away, before it notices me!~
@3303=~NOT IN THE FACE, NOT IN THE FACE!~
@3304=~Please please please just make it go away!~
@3305=~Y-you... you killed it! Yipee! Thank you thank you! I'm gettin' outta here now!~

// Illasera TOB

@5001=~Illasera. I had wondered when we'd see each other again.~
@5002=~Illasera, it's been too long. I had hoped when we crossed paths, it would be as friends again.~
@5003=~We're a long way from Baldur's Gate, Illasera. Come to finish the job?~
@5004=~Too long. <CHARNAME>. Too long. Our partnership against Sarevok was a rare treat. However, I'm afraid our paths now cross under different circumstances. You stand in the way of my greatness. My destiny. So you must be destroyed.~
@5005=~What do you mean, destiny? Why do you hunt me?~
@5006=~Damn your naiveté, <CHARNAME>. Yes, I enjoyed your company! There, I said it! But what is... 'friendship' in the face of greatness? Whatever we had before? I've killed and buried it. Nothing so sentimental can get in the way of my ambitions. My destiny.~
@5007=~What do you mean, destiny? Why do you hunt me?~
@5008=~You had to know I would come again for you, <CHARNAME>. For too long, you've counted yourself as that rarest of creature. A target that has escaped me.~
@5009=~Not all of us have been wandering Faerûn like witless cattle, like you and pathetic Imoen and so many others of Bhaal's blood. Some of us have far greater aspirations.~ [ILLASE09]
@5010=~The time of Alaundo's prophecy has come, <CHARNAME>. These rhyming ghosts here should have told you that much. Great things are afoot... and your contribution will be your death.~ [ILLASE10]
@5011=~I haven't sat idle between my time up north and now, Illasera. You'll find me more challenging foe than any you've fought.~
@5012=~You disappoint me Illasera. I had thought you of all people wouldn't bow to 'destiny'.~
@5013=~Who put you up to this, Illasera? Someone is leading you down this path and I'd know who.~
@5014=~I'm done talking. This ends now.~
@5015=~Isn't it obvious? I am Bhaalspawn myself, dear <CHARNAME>.~ 
@5016=~And neither have I. Perhaps it brings no comfort to you, but I confide to you this; I've been looking forward to facing you for quite some time. The thought of facing off against you sends little shivers down my spine. Oh, can you feel it too? Sister against <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>, fighting to the death to see just who is the -best-.~
@5017=~I fully accept that this battle may not even end in my favor, and with a chance significantly higher than I usually allow. But I can bear this suspense no longer. I -must- know which of us is truly the strongest. If you should prevail here, know that you'll have my utmost respect, for what that's worth.~
@5018=~I've run from my destiny for long enough. Some things are inescapable. If it at least intends for me to achieve greatness, why should I not let it lead me there?~
@5019=~*snort* Please. You don't expect for me to lay out the details of our 'master plan' to you so effortlessly, do you? I owe no such information to you.~

@5020 = ~*Imoen shares a few more stories from Candlekeep as you all drink together*~
@5021 = ~"Thank you both for sharing a drink with me. This has been pleasant. I must get to work on our final attack on Cherise, but I will contact you when I am ready. Be well."~

// BG0167.baf

@5022 = ~Now lets see here. I have all my Harper correspondences and records here. Gimmie a minute~
@5023 = ~Ok, got them!~

// WIillase.d-d-diamond

@5024 = ~Well...~

// WIcuts7.baf

@5025 = ~Sister, do you feel it?~
@5026 = ~Yes. A rumbling in the earth.~
@5027 = ~We must hide, quickly!~
@5028 = ~City dwellers, beware. Something comes.~

// WIcuts16.baf 

@5029 = ~Boooooored now.~
@5030 = ~This conversation has gotta be way better than what they're talking about out there.~
